Abstract: **We propose that between-mode fluctuations may generate unambiguous error signals that enable optimal inference and learning in volatile environments.**

Introduction: **When less sensitive to external stimulus information, humans and mice did not behave more randomly, but showed stronger serial dependencies in their perceptual choices[@fischer_serial_2014; @Liberman2014; @Abrahamyan2016; @Cicchini2014; @Cicchini2017; @Fritsche2020; @Urai2017; @Akrami2018; @Braun2018; @Bergen2019; @Urai2019; @Hsu2020].** These serial dependencies may be understood as driven by internal predictions that reflect the auto-correlation of natural environments[@Dong1995] and bias perception toward preceding experiences[@Burr2014; @Braun2018; @Bergen2019]. Computational modeling indicated that ongoing changes in perceptual performance may be driven by systematic fluctuations between externally- and internally-oriented modes of sensory analysis. **We discuss that such bimodal inference help to build up stable internal representations of the sensory environment despite an ongoing stream of sensory information**.

Removal and corrected and uncorrected stats:
- group-level autocorrelation curves are now reported with all corrections (autocorrelation in difficulty and sequence of sensory stimulation) in the main manuscript; Supplement shows autocorrelation for difficulty and the associated statistics. 

We have furthermore moved more peripheral statistical results to the figure legends and the method section to further streamline our manuscript. The following changes have been made (highlights in the manuscript): 

- we have moved the statistics on exponential decay in the autocorrelation to the figure legends of Figure XB and XB
- we have shortened the description of logistic regression models that predict the stimulus- and history-congruence at the index trial from the stimulus- and history-congruence at the preceding trials


Results: 
at the group level, stimulus-congruent perceptual choices were significantly autocorrelated for up to `r min(which(Summary_acf[Summary_acf$Variable == "diff_acf_Stimulus",]$p == "> 0.05")) - 1` trials. Autocorrelation coefficients decayed exponentially over time (rate $\gamma$ = $`r STAT.lmer_acf_Stimulus$coefficients[2,1]`$ Â± $`r STAT.lmer_acf_Stimulus$coefficients[2,2]`$, T($`r STAT.lmer_acf_Stimulus$coefficients[2,3]`$) = $`r STAT.lmer_acf_Stimulus$coefficients[2,4]`$, p = $`r STAT.lmer_acf_Stimulus$coefficients[2,5]`$; Figure 2B). Importantly, the autocorrelation of stimulus-congruent perception was not a trivial consequence of the experimental design, but remained significant when controlling for the trial-wise autocorrelation of task difficulty (Supplemental Figure S2A) or the sequence of presented stimuli (Supplemental Figure S2B).
