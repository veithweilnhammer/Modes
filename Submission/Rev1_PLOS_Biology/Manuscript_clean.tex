\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

Perception is known to cycle through periods of enhanced and reduced
sensitivity to external information. Here, we asked whether such slow
fluctuations arise as a noise-related epiphenomenon of limited
processing capacity or, alternatively, represent a structured mechanism
of perceptual inference. Using two large-scale datasets, we found that
humans and mice alternate between externally- and internally-oriented
modes of sensory analysis. During external mode, perception aligns more
closely with the external sensory information, whereas internal mode is
characterized by enhanced biases toward perceptual history.
Computational modeling indicated that dynamic changes in mode are
enabled by two interlinked factors: (i), the integration of subsequent
inputs over time and, (ii), slow anti-phase oscillations in the
perceptual impact of external sensory information versus internal
predictions that are provided by perceptual history. We propose that
between-mode fluctuations generate unambiguous error signals that enable
optimal inference in volatile environments.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The capacity to respond to changes in the environment is a defining
feature of life\textsuperscript{1--3}. Intriguingly, the ability of
living things to process their surroundings fluctuates considerably over
time\textsuperscript{4,5}. In humans and mice,
perception\textsuperscript{6--12}, cognition\textsuperscript{13} and
memory\textsuperscript{14} cycle through prolonged periods of enhanced
and reduced sensitivity to external information, suggesting that the
brain detaches from the world in recurring intervals that last from
milliseconds to seconds and even minutes\textsuperscript{4}. Yet
breaking from external information is risky, as swift responses to the
environment are often crucial to survival.

What could be the reason for these fluctuations in perceptual
performance\textsuperscript{11}? First, periodic fluctuations in the
ability to parse external information\textsuperscript{11,15,16} may
arise simply due to bandwidth limitations and noise. Second, it may be
advantageous to actively reduce the costs of neural processing by
seeking sensory information only in recurring
intervals\textsuperscript{17}, otherwise relying on random or
stereotypical responses to the external world. Third, spending time away
from the ongoing stream of sensory inputs may also reflect a functional
strategy that facilitates flexible behavior and
learning\textsuperscript{18}: Intermittently relying more strongly on
information acquired from past experiences may enable agents to build up
stable internal predictions about the environment despite an ongoing
stream of external sensory signals\textsuperscript{19}. By the same
token, recurring intervals of enhanced sensitivity to external
information may help to detect changes in both the state of the
environment and the amount of noise that is inherent in sensory
encoding\textsuperscript{19}.

In this work, we sought to elucidate whether periodicities in the
sensitivity to external information represent an epiphenomenon of
limited processing capacity or, alternatively, result from a structured
and adaptive mechanism of perceptual inference. To this end, we analyzed
two large-scale datasets on perceptual decision-making in
humans\textsuperscript{20} and mice\textsuperscript{21}. When less
sensitive to external stimulus information, humans and mice did not
behave more randomly, but showed stronger serial dependencies in their
perceptual choices\textsuperscript{22--33}. These serial dependencies
may be understood as driven by internal predictions that reflect the
autocorrelation of natural environments\textsuperscript{34} and bias
perception toward preceding experiences\textsuperscript{30,31,35}.
Computational modeling indicated that ongoing changes in perceptual
performance may be driven by systematic fluctuations between externally-
and internally-oriented \emph{modes} of sensory analysis. We suggest
that such \emph{bimodal inference} may help to build stable internal
representations of the sensory environment despite an ongoing stream of
sensory information.

\section{Results}\label{results}}

\hypertarget{human-perception-fluctuates-between-epochs-of-enhanced-and-reduced-sensitivity-to-external-information}{%
\subsection{Human perception fluctuates between epochs of enhanced and
reduced sensitivity to external
information}\label{human-perception-fluctuates-between-epochs-of-enhanced-and-reduced-sensitivity-to-external-information}}

We began by selecting 66 studies from the Confidence
Database\textsuperscript{20} that investigated how human participants (N
= 4317) perform binary perceptual decisions (Figure 1A; see Methods for
details on inclusion criteria). As a metric for perceptual performance
(i.e., the sensitivity to external sensory information), we asked
whether the participant's response and the presented stimulus matched
(\emph{stimulus-congruent} choices) or differed from each other
(\emph{stimulus-incongruent} choices; Figure 1B and C) in a total of
\(21.05\) million trials.

In a first step, we asked whether the ability to accurately perceive
sensory stimuli is constant over time or, alternatively, fluctuates in
periods of enhanced and reduced sensitivity to external information. We
found perception to be stimulus-congruent in 73.46\% ± 0.15\% of trials
(mean ± standard error of the mean; Figure 2A), which was highly
consistent across the selected studies (Supplemental Figure S1A). In
line with previous work\textsuperscript{8}, we found that the
probability of stimulus-congruence was not independent across successive
trials: At the group level, stimulus-congruent perceptual choices were
significantly autocorrelated for up to 15 trials (Figure 2B),
controlling for task difficulty and the sequence of presented stimuli
(Supplemental Figure 2A-B).

At the level of individual participants, the autocorrelation of
stimulus-congruence exceeded the respective autocorrelation of randomly
permuted data within an interval of \(3.24\) ±
\(\ensuremath{2.39\times 10^{-3}}\) trials (Figure 2C). In other words,
if a participant's experience was congruent (or incongruent) with the
external stimulus information at a given trial, her perception was more
likely to remain stimulus-congruent (or -incongruent) for approximately
3 trials into the future. The autocorrelation of stimulus-congruence was
corroborated by logistic regression models that successfully predicted
the stimulus-congruence of perception at the index trial \(t = 0\) from
the stimulus-congruence at the preceding trials within a lag of 16
trials (Supplemental Figure S3).

These results confirm that the ability to process sensory signals is not
constant over time but unfolds in multi-trial epochs of enhanced and
reduced sensitivity to external information\textsuperscript{8}. As a
consequence of this autocorrelation, the dynamic probability of
stimulus-congruent perception (i.e., computed in sliding windows of ± 5
trials; Figure 1C) fluctuated considerably within participants (average
minimum: 35.46\% ± 0.22\%, maximum: 98.27\% ± 0.07\%). In line with
previous findings\textsuperscript{9}, such fluctuations in the
sensitivity to external information had a power density that was
inversely proportional to the frequency in the slow
spectrum\textsuperscript{11} (power \textasciitilde{} 1/\(f^\beta\),
\(\beta\) = \(-1.32\) ± \(\ensuremath{3.14\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.84\times 10^{5}}\)) = \(-419.48\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\); Figure
2D). This feature, which is also known as a \emph{1/f power
law}\textsuperscript{36,37}, represents a characteristic of scale-free
fluctuations in complex dynamic systems such as the
brain\textsuperscript{38} and the cognitive processes it
entertains\textsuperscript{9,10,13,39,40}.

\hypertarget{humans-fluctuate-between-external-and-internal-modes-of-sensory-processing}{%
\subsection{Humans fluctuate between external and internal modes of
sensory
processing}\label{humans-fluctuate-between-external-and-internal-modes-of-sensory-processing}}

In a second step, we sought to explain why perception cycles through
periods of enhanced and reduced sensitivity to external
information\textsuperscript{4}. We reasoned that observers may
intermittently rely more strongly on internal information, i.e., on
predictions about the environment that are constructed from previous
experiences\textsuperscript{19,31}.

In perception, \emph{serial dependencies} represent one of the most
basic internal predictions that cause perceptual decisions to be
systematically biased toward preceding choices\textsuperscript{22--33}.
Such effects of perceptual history mirror the continuity of the external
world, in which the recent past often predicts the near
future\textsuperscript{30,31,34,35,41}. Therefore, as a metric for the
perceptual impact of internal information, we computed whether the
participant's response at a given trial matched or differed from her
response at the preceding trial (\emph{history-congruent} and
\emph{history-incongruent perception}, respectively; Figure 1B and C).

First, we confirmed that perceptual history played a significant role in
perception despite the ongoing stream of external information. With a
global average of 52.7\% ± 0.12\% history-congruent trials, we found a
small but highly significant perceptual bias towards preceding
experiences (\(\beta\) = \(16.18\) ± \(1.07\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.09\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(15.07\), p =
\(\ensuremath{10^{-46}}\); Figure 2A) that was largely consistent across
studies (Supplemental Figure 1B) and more pronounced in participants who
were less sensitive to external sensory information (Supplemental Figure
1C). Importantly, history-congruence was not a corollary of the sequence
of presented stimuli: History-congruent perceptual choices were more
frequent at trials when perception was stimulus-incongruent (56.03\% ±
0.2\%) as opposed to stimulus-congruent (51.77\% ± 0.11\%, \(\beta\) =
\(-4.26\) ± \(0.21\), T(\(\ensuremath{8.57\times 10^{3}}\)) =
\(-20.36\), p = \(\ensuremath{5.28\times 10^{-90}}\); Figure 2A, lower
panel). Despite being adaptive in autocorrelated real-world
environments\textsuperscript{19,34,35,42}, perceptual history thus
represented a source of bias in the randomized experimental designs
studied here\textsuperscript{24,28,30,31,43}. These serial biases were
effects of choice history, i.e., driven by the experiences reported at
the preceding trial, and could not be attributed to stimulus history,
i.e., to effects of the stimuli presented at the preceding trial
(Supplemental Section 9.1).

Second, we asked whether perception cycles through multi-trial epochs
during which perception is characterized by stronger or weaker biases
toward preceding experiences. In close analogy to stimulus-congruence,
we found history-congruence to be significantly autocorrelated for up to
21 trials (Figure 2B), while controlling for task difficulty and the
sequence of presented stimuli (Supplemental Figure 2A-B). In individual
participants, the autocorrelation of history-congruence was elevated
above randomly permuted data for a lag of \(4.87\) ±
\(\ensuremath{3.36\times 10^{-3}}\) trials (Figure 2C), confirming that
the autocorrelation of history-congruence was not only a group-level
phenomenon. The autocorrelation of history-congruence was corroborated
by logistic regression models that successfully predicted the
history-congruence of perception at an index trial \(t = 0\) from the
history-congruence at the preceding trials within a lag of 17 trials
(Supplemental Figure S3).

Third, we asked whether the impact of internal information fluctuates as
a scale-invariant process with a 1/f power law (i.e., the feature
typically associated with fluctuations in the sensitivity to external
information\textsuperscript{9,10,13,39,40}). The dynamic probability of
history-congruent perception (i.e., computed in sliding windows of ± 5
trials; Figure 1C) varied considerably over time, ranging between a
minimum of 12.77\% ± 0.14\% and a maximum 92.23\% ± 0.14\%. In analogy
to stimulus-congruence, we found that history-congruence fluctuated as
at power densities that were inversely proportional to the frequency in
the slow spectrum\textsuperscript{11} (power \textasciitilde{}
1/\(f^\beta\), \(\beta\) = \(-1.34\) ±
\(\ensuremath{3.16\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.84\times 10^{5}}\)) = \(-423.91\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\); Figure
2D).

Finally, we ensured that fluctuations in stimulus- and
history-congruence are linked to each other. When perceptual choices
were less biased toward external information, participants relied more
strongly on internal information acquired from perceptual history (and
vice versa, \(\beta\) = \(-0.05\) ± \(\ensuremath{5.63\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.1\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-84.21\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\),
controlling for fluctuations in general response biases; Supplemental
Section 9.2). Thus, while sharing the 1/f power law characteristic,
fluctuations in stimulus- and history-congruence were shifted against
each other by approximately half a cycle and showed a squared coherence
of \(6.49\) ± \(\ensuremath{2.07\times 10^{-3}}\)\% (Figure 2E and F; we
report the average phase and coherence for frequencies below 0.1
\(1/N_{trials}\); see Methods for details).

In sum, our analyses indicate that perceptual decisions may result from
a competition between external sensory signals with internal predictions
provided by perceptual history. We show that the impact of these
external and internal sources of information is not stable over time,
but fluctuates systematically, emitting overlapping autocorrelation
curves and antiphase 1/f profiles.

These links between stimulus- and history-congruence suggest that the
fluctuations in the impact of external and internal information may be
generated by a unifying mechanism that causes perception to alternate
between two opposing \emph{modes}\textsuperscript{18} (Figure 1D):
During \emph{external mode}, perception is more strongly driven by the
available external stimulus information. Conversely, during
\emph{internal mode}, participants rely more heavily on internal
predictions that are implicitly provided by preceding perceptual
experiences. The fluctuations in the degree of bias toward external
versus internal information created by such \emph{bimodal inference} may
thus provide a novel explanation for ongoing fluctuations in the
sensitivity to external information\textsuperscript{4,5,18}.

\hypertarget{internal-and-external-modes-of-processing-facilitate-response-behavior-and-enhance-confidence-in-human-perceptual-decision-making}{%
\subsection{Internal and external modes of processing facilitate
response behavior and enhance confidence in human perceptual
decision-making}\label{internal-and-external-modes-of-processing-facilitate-response-behavior-and-enhance-confidence-in-human-perceptual-decision-making}}

The above results point to systematic fluctuations in the \emph{decision
variable}\textsuperscript{44} that determines perceptual choices,
causing enhanced sensitivity to external stimulus information during
external mode and increased biases toward preceding choices during
internal mode. As such, fluctuations in mode should influence downstream
aspects of behavior and cognition that operate on the perceptual
decision variable\textsuperscript{44}. To test this hypothesis with
respect to motor behavior and metacognition, we asked how bimodal
inference relates to response times (RTs) and confidence reports.

With respect to RTs, we observed faster responses for stimulus-congruent
as opposed to stimulus-incongruent choices (\(\beta\) = \(-0.14\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.6\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.99\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-85.84\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\); Figure
2G). Intriguingly, whilst controlling for the effect of
stimulus-congruence, we found that history-congruent (as opposed to
history-incongruent) choices were also characterized by faster responses
(\(\beta\) = \(\ensuremath{-9.56\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.37\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.98\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-6.97\), p =
\(\ensuremath{3.15\times 10^{-12}}\); Figure 2G).

When analyzing the speed of response against the mode of sensory
processing (Figure 2H), we found that RTs were shorter during
externally-oriented perception (\(\beta_1\) = \(-11.07\) ± \(0.55\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.98\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-20.14\), p =
\(\ensuremath{3.17\times 10^{-90}}\)). Crucially, as indicated by a
quadratic relationship between the mode of sensory processing and RTs
(\(\beta_2\) = \(-19.86\) ± \(0.52\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.98\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-38.43\), p =
\(\ensuremath{5\times 10^{-323}}\)), participants became faster at
indicating their perceptual decision when biases toward both internal
and external mode grew stronger.

In analogy to the speed of response, confidence was higher for
stimulus-congruent as opposed to stimulus-incongruent choices (\(\beta\)
= \(0.04\) ± \(\ensuremath{1.18\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.06\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(36.85\), p =
\(\ensuremath{3.25\times 10^{-297}}\); Figure 2I). Yet whilst
controlling for the effect of stimulus-congruence, we found that
history-congruence also increased confidence (\(\beta\) = \(0.48\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.38\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.06\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(351.54\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\); Figure
2I).

When depicted against the mode of sensory processing (Figure 2J),
subjective confidence was indeed enhanced when perception was more
externally-oriented (\(\beta_1\) = \(92.63\) ± \(1\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.06\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(92.89\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\)).
Importantly, however, participants were more confident in their
perceptual decision for stronger biases toward both internal and
external mode (\(\beta_2\) = \(39.3\) ± \(0.94\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.06\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(41.95\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\)). In
analogy to RTs, subjective confidence thus showed a quadratic
relationship to the mode of sensory processing (Figure 2J).

Consequently, our findings predict that human participants lack full
metacognitive insight into how strongly external signals and internal
predictions contribute to perceptual decision-making. Stronger biases
toward perceptual history thus lead to two seemingly contradictory
effects, more frequent errors (Supplemental Figure 1C) and increasing
subjective confidence (Figure 2I-J). This observation generates an
intriguing prediction regarding the association of between-mode
fluctuations and perceptual metacognition: Metacognitive efficiency
should be lower in individuals who spend more time in internal mode,
since their confidence reports are less predictive of whether the
corresponding perceptual decision is correct. We computed each
participant's M-ratio\textsuperscript{45} (meta-d'/d' = 0.85 ± 0.02) to
probe this hypothesis independently of inter-individual differences in
perceptual performance. Indeed, we found that biases toward internal
information (as defined by the average probability of
history-congruence) were stronger in participants with lower
metacognitive efficiency (\(\beta\) =
\(\ensuremath{-2.98\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{9.82\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{4.14\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(-3.03\), p =
\(\ensuremath{2.43\times 10^{-3}}\)).

In sum, the above results indicate that reporting behavior and
metacognition do not map linearly onto the mode of sensory processing.
Rather, they suggest that slow fluctuations in the respective impact of
external and internal information are most likely to affect perception
at an early level of sensory analysis\textsuperscript{46,47}. Such
low-level processing may thus integrate perceptual history with external
inputs into a decision variable\textsuperscript{44} that influences not
only perceptual choices, but also the speed and confidence at which they
are made.

In what follows, we probe alternative explanations for between-mode
fluctuations, test for the existence of modes in mice, and propose a
predictive processing model that explains fluctuations in mode ongoing
shifts in the precision afforded to external sensory information
relative to internal predictions driven by perceptual history.

\hypertarget{fluctuations-between-internal-and-external-mode-cannot-be-reduced-to-general-response-biases-or-random-choices}{%
\subsection{Fluctuations between internal and external mode cannot be
reduced to general response biases or random
choices}\label{fluctuations-between-internal-and-external-mode-cannot-be-reduced-to-general-response-biases-or-random-choices}}

The core assumption of bimodal inference - that ongoing changes in the
sensitivity to external information are driven by internal predictions
induced via perceptual history - needs to be contrasted against two
alternative hypotheses: When making errors, observers may not engage
with the task and respond stereotypically, i.e., exhibit stronger
general biases toward one of the two potential outcomes, or simply
choose randomly.

Logistic regression confirmed that perceptual history made a significant
contribution to perception (\(\beta\) = \(0.11\) ±
\(\ensuremath{5.79\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(18.53\), p =
\(\ensuremath{1.1\times 10^{-76}}\)) over and above the ongoing stream
of external sensory information (\(\beta\) = \(2.2\) ±
\(\ensuremath{5.87\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(375.11\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\)) and
general response biases toward (\(\beta\) = \(15.19\) ± \(0.08\), z =
\(184.98\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\)).

When eliminating perceptual history as a predictor of individual choices
at individual trials, Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC\textsuperscript{48}) increased by \(\delta_{AIC}\) =
\(\ensuremath{1.64\times 10^{3}}\) (see Supplemental Figure S4A-B for
parameter- and model-level inference at the level of individual
observers). Likewise, when eliminating slow fluctuations in
history-congruence as a predictor of slow fluctuations in
stimulus-congruence across trials, we observed an increase in AIC by
\(\delta_{AIC}\) = \(\ensuremath{7.06\times 10^{3}}\). These results
provided model-level evidence against the null hypotheses that
fluctuations in stimulus-congruence are driven exclusively by choice
randomness or general response bias (see Supplemental Section 9.2 and
Supplemental Figure S5 for an in-depth assessment of general response
bias).

To confirm that changes in the sensitivity to external information are
indicative of internal mode processing, we estimated full and
history-dependent psychometric curves during internal, external, and
across modes\textsuperscript{21}. If, as we hypothesized, internal mode
processing reflects an enhanced impact of perceptual history, one would
expect a history-dependent increase in biases and lapses as well as a
history-independent increase in threshold. Conversely, if internal mode
processing were driven by random choices, one would expect a
history-independent increase in lapses and threshold, and no change in
bias. In line with our prediction, we found that internal mode
processing was associated with a history-dependent increase in bias and
lapse as well as a history-independent increase in threshold
(Supplemental Section 9.3.1 and Supplemental Figure S6). This confirmed
that internal mode processing is indeed driven by an enhanced impact of
perceptual history.

In line with this, the quadratic relationship between mode and
confidence (Figure 2J) suggested that biases toward internal information
do not reflect a post-perceptual strategy of repeating preceding choices
when the subjective confidence in the perceptual decision is low.
Moreover, while responses became faster with longer exposure to the
experiments of the Confidence database, the frequency of
history-congruent choices increased over time, speaking against the
proposition that participants stereotypically repeat preceding choices
when not yet familiar with the experimental task (Supplemental Section
9.4.1).

Taken together, our results thus argue against recurring intervals of
low task engagement, which may be signaled by stereotypical or random
responses, as an alternative explanation for the phenomenon that we
identify as bimodal inference.

\subsection{Mice fluctuate between external and internal modes of
sensory
processing}\label{mice-fluctuate-between-external-and-internal-modes-of-sensory-processing}}

In a prominent functional explanation for serial
dependencies\textsuperscript{22--28,32,33,46}, perceptual history is
cast as an internal prediction that leverages the temporal
autocorrelation of natural environments for efficient
decision-making\textsuperscript{30,31,34,35,41}. Since this
autocorrelation is one of the most basic features of our sensory world,
fluctuating biases toward preceding perceptual choices should not be a
uniquely human phenomenon.

To test whether externally- and internally-oriented modes of processing
exist beyond the human mind, we analyzed data on perceptual
decision-making in mice that were extracted from the International Brain
Laboratory (IBL) dataset\textsuperscript{21}. We restricted our analyses
to the \emph{basic} task\textsuperscript{21}, in which mice responded to
gratings of varying contrast that appeared either in the left or right
hemifield of with equal probability. We excluded sessions in which mice
did not respond correctly to stimuli presented at a contrast above 50\%
in more than 80\% of trials (see Methods for details), which yielded a
final sample of N = 165 adequately trained mice that went through
\(1.46\) million trials.

We found perception to be stimulus-congruent in 81.37\% ± 0.3\% of
trials (Figure 3A, upper panel). In line with humans, mice were biased
toward perceptual history in 54.03\% ± 0.17\% of trials (T(164) = 23.65,
p = \(\ensuremath{9.98\times 10^{-55}}\); Figure 3A and Supplemental
Figure S1D). Since the \emph{basic} task of the IBL dataset presented
stimuli at random in either the left or right
hemifield\textsuperscript{21}, we expected stronger biases toward
perceptual history to decrease perceptual performance. Indeed,
history-congruent choices were more frequent when perception was
stimulus-incongruent (61.59\% ± 0.07\%) as opposed to stimulus-congruent
(51.81\% ± 0.02\%, T(164) = 31.37, p =
\(\ensuremath{3.36\times 10^{-71}}\); T(164) = 31.37, p =
\(\ensuremath{3.36\times 10^{-71}}\); Figure 3A, lower panel),
confirming that perceptual history was a source of
bias\textsuperscript{24,28,30,31,43} as opposed to a feature of the
experimental paradigm.

At the group level, we found significant autocorrelations in both
stimulus-congruence (42 consecutive trials) and history-congruence (8
consecutive trials; Figure 3B), while controlling for the respective
autocorrelation of task difficulty and external stimulation
(Supplemental Figure 2C-D). In contrast to humans, mice showed a
negative autocorrelation coefficient of stimulus-congruence at trial 2,
which was due to a feature of the experimental design: Errors at a
contrast above 50\% were followed by a high-contrast stimulus at the
same location. Thus, stimulus-incongruent choices on easy trials were
more likely to be followed by stimulus-congruent perceptual choices that
were facilitated by high-contrast visual stimuli\textsuperscript{21}.

At the level of individual mice, autocorrelation coefficients were
elevated above randomly permuted data within a lag of 4.59 ± 0.06 trials
for stimulus-congruence and 2.58 ± 0.01 trials for history-congruence
(Figure 3C). We corroborated these autocorrelations in logistic
regression models that successfully predicted the
stimulus-/history-congruence of perception at the index trial \(t = 0\)
from the stimulus-/history-congruence at the 33 preceding trials for
stimulus-congruence and 8 preceding trials for history-congruence
(Supplemental Figure S3). In analogy to humans, mice showed anti-phase
1/f fluctuations in the sensitivity to internal and external information
(Figure 3D-F).

The above results confirm that fluctuations between internally- and
externally-biased modes generalize to perceptual decision-making in
mice. Following our hypothesis that bimodal inference operates at the
level of perception, we predicted that between-mode fluctuations
modulate a decision variable\textsuperscript{44} that determines not
only perceptual choices, but also downstream aspects of mouse
behavior\textsuperscript{44}. We therefore asked how external and
internal modes relate to the trial duration (TD, a coarse measure of RT
in mice that spans the interval from stimulus onset to
feedback\textsuperscript{21}). Stimulus-congruent (as opposed to
stimulus-incongruent) choices were associated with shorter TDs
(\(\delta\) = \(-262.48\) ± \(17.1\), T(164) = -15.35, p =
\(\ensuremath{1.55\times 10^{-33}}\)), while history-congruent choices
were characterized by longer TDs (\(\delta\) = \(30.47\) ± \(5.57\),
T(164) = 5.47, p = \(\ensuremath{1.66\times 10^{-7}}\); Figure 3G).

Across the full spectrum of the available data, TDs showed a linear
relationship with the mode of sensory processing, with shorter TDs
during external mode (\(\beta_1\) = \(\ensuremath{-4.16\times 10^{4}}\)
± \(\ensuremath{1.29\times 10^{3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.35\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-32.31\), p =
\(\ensuremath{6.03\times 10^{-229}}\), Figure 3H). However, an
explorative post-hoc analysis limited to TDs that differed from the
median TD by no more than 1.5 x MAD (median absolute
distance\textsuperscript{49}) indicated that, when mice engaged with the
task more swiftly, TDs did indeed show a quadratic relationship with the
mode of sensory processing (\(\beta_2\) =
\(\ensuremath{-1.97\times 10^{3}}\) ± \(843.74\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.19\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-2.34\), p = \(0.02\), Figure
3I).

As in humans, it is important to ensure that ongoing changes in the
sensitivity to external information are indeed driven by perceptual
history and cannot be reduced to general choice biases or random
behavior. Logistic regression confirmed a significant effect perceptual
history on perceptual choices (\(\beta\) = \(0.51\) ±
\(\ensuremath{4.49\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(112.84\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\)), while
controlling for external sensory information (\(\beta\) = \(2.96\) ±
\(\ensuremath{4.58\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(646.1\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\)) and
general response biases toward one of the two outcomes (\(\beta\) =
\(-1.78\) ± \(0.02\), z = \(-80.64\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\)). When eliminating
perceptual history as a predictor of individual choices, AIC increased
by \(\delta_{AIC}\) = \(\ensuremath{1.48\times 10^{4}}\), arguing
against the notion that choice randomness and general response bias are
the only determinants of perceptual performance in mice (see
Supplemental Figure S4C-D for parameter- and model-level inference in
individual subjects).

In mice, fluctuations in the strength of history-congruent biases had a
significant effect on stimulus-congruence (\(\beta_1\) = \(-0.12\) ±
\(\ensuremath{7.17\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.34\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-168.39\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\)) beyond
the effect of ongoing changes in general response biases (\(\beta_2\) =
\(-0.03\) ± \(\ensuremath{6.94\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.34\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-48.14\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\)).
Eliminating the dynamic fluctuations in history-congruence as a
predictor of fluctuations in stimulus-congruence resulted in an increase
in AIC by \(\delta_{AIC}\) = \(\ensuremath{2.8\times 10^{4}}\) (see
Supplemental Section 9.2 and Supplemental Figure S5 for an in-depth
assessment of general response bias).

When fitting full and history-conditioned psychometric curves to the IBL
data\textsuperscript{21}, we observed that internal mode processing was
associated with a history-dependent increase in bias and lapse as well
as a history-independent increase in threshold (Supplemental Section
9.3.2 and Supplemental Figure S7). Over time, the frequency of
history-congruent choices increased alongside stimulus-congruence and
speed of response as mice were exposed to the experiment, arguing
against the proposition that biases toward perceptual history reflected
an unspecific response strategy in mice who were not sufficiently
trained on the IBL task (Supplemental Section 9.4.2 and Supplemental
Figure S8).

In sum, these analyses confirmed that the observed fluctuations in
sensitivity to external sensory information are driven by dynamic
changes in impact of perceptual history and cannot be reduced to general
response bias and random choice behavior.

\hypertarget{fluctuations-in-mode-result-from-coordinated-changes-in-the-impact-of-external-and-internal-information-on-perception}{%
\subsection{Fluctuations in mode result from coordinated changes in the
impact of external and internal information on
perception}\label{fluctuations-in-mode-result-from-coordinated-changes-in-the-impact-of-external-and-internal-information-on-perception}}

The empirical data presented above indicate that, for both humans and
mice, perception fluctuates between external and modes, i.e.,
multi-trial epochs that are characterized by enhanced sensitivity toward
either external sensory information or internal predictions generated by
perceptual history. Since natural environments typically show high
temporal redundancy\textsuperscript{34}, previous experiences are often
good predictors of new stimuli\textsuperscript{30,31,35,41}. Serial
dependencies may therefore induce autocorrelations in perception by
serving as internal predictions (or \emph{memory}
processes\textsuperscript{9,13}) that actively integrate noisy sensory
information over time\textsuperscript{50}.

Previous work has shown that such internal predictions can be built by
dynamically updating the estimated probability of being in a particular
perceptual state from the sequence of preceding
experiences\textsuperscript{35,46,51}. The integration of sequential
inputs may lead to accumulating effects of perceptual history that
progressively override incoming sensory information, enabling internal
mode processing\textsuperscript{19}. However, since such a process would
lead to internal biases that may eventually become impossible to
overcome\textsuperscript{52}, changes in mode may require ongoing
wave-like fluctuations\textsuperscript{9,13} in the perceptual impact of
external and internal information that occur \emph{irrespective} of the
sequence of previous experiences and temporarily de-couple the decision
variable from implicit internal representations of the
environment\textsuperscript{19}.

Following Bayes' theorem, binary perceptual decisions depend on the log
posterior ratio \(L\) of the two alternative states of the environment
that participants learn about via noisy sensory
information\textsuperscript{51}. We computed the posterior by combining
the sensory evidence available at time-point \(t\) (i.e., the log
likelihood ratio \(LLR\)) with the prior probability \(\psi\), weighted
by the respective precision terms \(\omega_{LLR}\) and
\(\omega_{\psi}\):

\begin{equation}
L_t = LLR_t * \omega_{LLR} + \psi_t(L_{t-1}, H) * \omega_{\psi}
\end{equation}

We derived the prior probability \(\psi\) at timepoint \(t\) from the
posterior probability of perceptual outcomes at timepoint \(L_{t-1}\).
Since a switch between the two states can occur at any time, the effect
of perceptual history varies according to both the sequence of preceding
experiences and the estimated stability of the external environment
(i.e., the \emph{hazard rate} \(H\)\textsuperscript{51}):

\begin{equation}
\psi_t(L_{t-1}, H)  = L_{t-1} + log(\frac{1-H}{H} + exp(-L_{t-1})) - log(\frac{1-H}{H} + exp(L_{t-1}))
\end{equation}

The \(LLR\) was computed from inputs \(s_t\) by applying a sigmoid
function defined by parameter \(\alpha\) that controls the sensitivity
of perception to the available sensory information (see Methods for
details on \(s_t\) in humans and mice):

\begin{equation}
u_t = \frac{1}{1 + exp(-\alpha * s_t)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
LLR_t = log(\frac{u_t}{1-u_t})
\end{equation}

To allow for bimodal inference, i.e., alternating periods of internally-
and externally-biased modes of perceptual processing that occur
irrespective of the sequence of preceding experiences, we assumed that
likelihood and prior vary in their influence on the perceptual decision
according to fluctuations governed by \(\omega_{LLR}\) and
\(\omega_{\psi}\). These anti-phase sine functions (defined by
amplitudes \(a_{LLR/\psi}\), frequency \(f\) and phase \(p\)) determine
the precision afforded to the likelihood and prior\textsuperscript{53}.
The implicit anti-phase fluctuations are mandated by Bayes-optimal
formulations in which inference depends only on the relative values of
prior and likelihood precision (i.e., the Kalman
gain\textsuperscript{54}). As such, \(\omega_{LLR}\) and
\(\omega_{\psi}\) implement a hyperprior\textsuperscript{55} in which
the likelihood and prior precisions are shifted against each other at a
dominant timescale defined by \(f\):

\begin{equation}
\omega_{LLR} = a_{LLR} * sin(f * t + p) + 1
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\omega_{\psi} = a_{\psi} * sin(f * t + p + \pi) + 1
\end{equation}

Finally, a sigmoid transform of the posterior \(L_t\) yields the
probability of observing the perceptual decision \(y_t\) at a
temperature determined by \(\zeta^{-1}\):

\begin{equation}
P(y_t = 1) = 1 - P(y_t = 0) = \frac{1}{1 + exp(-\zeta * L_t)}
\end{equation}

We used a maximum likelihood procedure to fit the bimodal inference
model (M1, Figure 1F) to the behavioral data from the Confidence
database\textsuperscript{20} and the IBL database\textsuperscript{21},
optimizing the parameters \(\alpha\), \(H\), \(amp_{LLR}\),
\(amp_{\psi}\), \(f\), \(p\) and \(\zeta\) (see Methods for details and
Supplemental Table T2 for a summary of the parameters of the bimodal
inference model). We validated our model in three steps:

First, to show that bimodal inference does not emerge spontaneously in
normative Bayesian models of evidence accumulation, but requires the
ad-hoc addition of anti-phase oscillations in prior and likelihood
precision, we compared the bimodal inference model to four control
models (M2-5, Figure 1G). In these models, we successively removed the
anti-phase oscillations (M2-M4) and the integration of information
across trials (M5) from the bimodal inference model and performed a
model comparison based on AIC.

Model M2 (\(AIC_2\) = \(\ensuremath{9.76\times 10^{4}}\) in humans and
\(\ensuremath{4.91\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) and Model M3 (\(AIC_3\) =
\(\ensuremath{1.19\times 10^{5}}\) in humans and
\(\ensuremath{5.95\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) incorporated only
oscillations of either likelihood or prior precision. Model M4
(\(AIC_4\) = \(\ensuremath{1.69\times 10^{5}}\) in humans and
\(\ensuremath{9.12\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) lacked any oscillations of
likelihood and prior precision and corresponded to the normative model
proposed by Glaze et al.\textsuperscript{51}. In model M5 (\(AIC_4\) =
\(\ensuremath{2.01\times 10^{5}}\) in humans and
\(\ensuremath{1.13\times 10^{5}}\) in mice), we furthermore removed the
integration of information across trials, such that perception depended
only in incoming sensory information (Figure 1G).

The bimodal inference model achieved the lowest AIC across the full
model space (\(AIC_1\) = \(\ensuremath{8.16\times 10^{4}}\) in humans
and \(\ensuremath{4.24\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) and was clearly superior
to the normative Bayesian model of evidence accumulation
(\(\delta_{AIC}\) = \(\ensuremath{-8.79\times 10^{4}}\) in humans and
\(\ensuremath{-4.87\times 10^{4}}\) in mice; Supplemental Figure S9).

As a second validation of the bimodal inference model, we tested whether
the posterior model predicted within-training and out-of-training
variables. The bimodal inference model characterizes each subject by a
sensitivity parameter \(\alpha\) (humans: \(\alpha\) = \(0.5\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.12\times 10^{-4}}\); mice: \(\alpha\) = \(1.06\) ±
\(\ensuremath{2.88\times 10^{-3}}\)) that captures how strongly
perception is driven by the available sensory information, and a hazard
rate parameter \(H\) (humans: \(H\) = \(0.45\) ±
\(\ensuremath{4.8\times 10^{-5}}\); mice: \(H\) = \(0.46\) ±
\(\ensuremath{2.97\times 10^{-4}}\)) that controls how heavily
perception is biased by perceptual history. The parameter \(f\) captures
the dominant time scale at which likelihood (amplitude humans:
\(a_{LLR}\) = \(0.5\) ± \(\ensuremath{2.02\times 10^{-4}}\); mice:
\(a_{LLR}\) = \(0.39\) ± \(\ensuremath{1.08\times 10^{-3}}\)) and prior
precision (amplitude humans: \(a_{\psi}\) = \(1.44\) ±
\(\ensuremath{5.27\times 10^{-4}}\); mice: \(a_{\psi}\) = \(1.71\) ±
\(\ensuremath{7.15\times 10^{-3}}\)) fluctuated and was estimated at
\(0.11\) ± \(\ensuremath{1.68\times 10^{-5}}\) 1/\(N_{trials}\) and
\(0.11\) ± \(\ensuremath{1.63\times 10^{-4}}\) 1/\(N_{trials}\) in mice.

As a sanity check for model fit, we tested whether the frequency of
stimulus- and history-congruent trials in the Confidence
database\textsuperscript{20} and IBL database\textsuperscript{21}
correlated with the estimated parameters \(\alpha\) and \(H\),
respectively. As expected, the estimated sensitivity toward stimulus
information \(\alpha\) was positively correlated with the frequency of
stimulus-congruent perceptual choices (humans: \(\beta\) = \(8.4\) ±
\(0.26\), T(\(\ensuremath{4.31\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(32.87\), p =
\(\ensuremath{1.3\times 10^{-211}}\); mice: \(\beta\) = \(1.93\) ±
\(0.12\), T(\(\ensuremath{2.07\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(16.21\), p =
\(\ensuremath{9.37\times 10^{-56}}\)). Likewise, \(H\) was negatively
correlated with the frequency of history-congruent perceptual choices
(humans: \(\beta\) = \(-11.84\) ± \(0.5\),
T(\(\ensuremath{4.29\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(-23.5\), p =
\(\ensuremath{5.16\times 10^{-115}}\); mice: \(\beta\) = \(-6.18\) ±
\(0.66\), T(\(\ensuremath{2.08\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(-9.37\), p =
\(\ensuremath{1.85\times 10^{-20}}\)).

Our behavioral analyses reveal that humans and mice show significant
effects of perceptual history that impaired performance in randomized
psychophysical experiments\textsuperscript{24,28,30,31,43} (Figure 2A
and 3A). We therefore expected that humans and mice underestimated the
true hazard rate \(\hat{H}\) of the experimental environments
(Confidence database\textsuperscript{20}: \(\hat{H}_{Humans}\) = \(0.5\)
± \(\ensuremath{1.58\times 10^{-5}}\)); IBL
database\textsuperscript{21}: \(\hat{H}_{Mice}\) = \(0.49\) ±
\(\ensuremath{6.47\times 10^{-5}}\)). Indeed, when fitting the bimodal
inference model to the trial-wise perceptual choices, we found that the
estimated (i.e., subjective) hazard rate \(H\) was lower than
\(\hat{H}\) for both humans (\(\beta\) = \(-6.87\) ± \(0.94\),
T(\(61.87\)) = \(-7.33\), p = \(\ensuremath{5.76\times 10^{-10}}\)) and
mice (\(\beta\) = \(-2.91\) ± \(0.34\), T(\(112.57\)) = \(-8.51\), p =
\(\ensuremath{8.65\times 10^{-14}}\)).

To further probe the validity of the bimodal inference model, we asked
whether posterior model quantities could explain aspects of the
behavioral data that the model was not fitted to. We predicted that the
posterior decision variable \(L_t\) not only encodes perceptual choices
(i.e., the variable used for model estimation), but also predicts the
speed of response and subjective confidence\textsuperscript{30,44}.
Indeed, the estimated trial-wise posterior decision certainty \(|L_t|\)
correlated negatively with RTs in humans (\(\beta\) =
\(\ensuremath{-4.36\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{4.64\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.98\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-9.41\), p =
\(\ensuremath{5.19\times 10^{-21}}\)) and TDs mice (\(\beta\) =
\(-35.45\) ± \(0.86\), T(\(\ensuremath{1.28\times 10^{6}}\)) =
\(-41.13\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\)). Likewise, subjective confidence reports were
positively correlated with the estimated posterior decision certainty in
humans (\(\beta\) = \(\ensuremath{7.63\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{8.32\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.06\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(9.18\), p =
\(\ensuremath{4.48\times 10^{-20}}\)).

The dynamic accumulation of information inherent to our model entails
that biases toward perceptual history are stronger when the posterior
decision certainty at the preceding trial is
high\textsuperscript{30,31,51}. Due to the link between posterior
decision certainty and confidence, confident perceptual choices should
be more likely to induce history-congruent perception at the subsequent
trial\textsuperscript{30,31}. In line with our prediction, logistic
regression indicated that history-congruence was predicted by the
posterior decision certainty \(|L_{t-1}|\) extracted from the model
(humans: \(\beta\) = \(\ensuremath{8.22\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.94\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(4.25\), p =
\(\ensuremath{2.17\times 10^{-5}}\); mice: \(\beta\) =
\(\ensuremath{-3.72\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.83\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(-2.03\), p = \(0.04\)) and
the subjective confidence reported by the participants (humans:
\(\beta\) = \(0.04\) ± \(\ensuremath{1.62\times 10^{-3}}\), z =
\(27.21\), p = \(\ensuremath{4.56\times 10^{-163}}\)) at the preceding
trial.

As a third validation of the bimodal inference model, we used the
posterior model parameters to simulate synthetic perceptual choices and
repeated the behavioral analyses conducted for the empirical data.
Simulations from the bimodal inference model closely replicated our
empirical results: Simulated perceptual decisions resulted from a
competition of perceptual history with incoming sensory signals (Figure
4A). Stimulus- and history-congruence were significantly autocorrelated
(Figure 4B-C), fluctuating in anti-phase as a scale-invariant process
with a 1/f power law (Figure 4D-F). Simulated posterior
certainty\textsuperscript{28,30,44} (i.e., the absolute of the log
posterior ratio \(|L_t|\)) showed a quadratic relationship to the mode
of sensory processing (Figure 4H), mirroring the relation of RTs and
confidence reports to external and internal biases in perception (Figure
2G-H and Figure 3G-H). Crucially, the overlap between empirical and
simulated data broke down when we removed the anti-phase oscillations or
the accumulation of evidence over time from the bimodal inference model
(Supplemental Figures S10-13).

In sum, computational modeling suggested that between-mode fluctuations
are best explained by two interlinked processes (Figure 1E and F): (i),
the dynamic accumulation of information across successive trials
mandated by normative Bayesian models of evidence accumulation and,
(ii), ongoing anti-phase oscillations in the impact of external and
internal information.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

This work investigates the behavioral and computational characteristics
of ongoing fluctuations in perceptual decision-making using two
large-scale datasets in humans\textsuperscript{20} and
mice\textsuperscript{21}. We found that humans and mice cycle through
recurring intervals of reduced sensitivity to external sensory
information, during which they rely more strongly on perceptual history,
i.e., an internal prediction that is provided by the sequence of
preceding choices. Computational modeling indicated that these slow
periodicities are governed by two interlinked factors: (i), the dynamic
integration of sensory inputs over time and, (ii), anti-phase
oscillations in the strength at which perception is driven by internal
versus external sources of information. These cross-species results
suggest that ongoing fluctuations in perceptual decision-making arise
not merely as a noise-related epiphenomenon of limited processing
capacity, but result from a structured and adaptive mechanism that
fluctuates between internally- and externally-oriented modes of sensory
analysis.

\subsection{Bimodal inference represents a pervasive aspect of
perceptual decision-making in humans and
mice}\label{bimodal-inference-represents-a-pervasive-aspect-of-perceptual-decision-making-in-humans-and-mice}}

A growing body of literature has highlighted that perception is
modulated by preceding choices\textsuperscript{22--28,30,32,33}. Our
work provides converging cross-species evidence supporting the notion
that such serial dependencies are a pervasive and general phenomenon of
perceptual decision-making (Figures 2 and 3). While introducing errors
in randomized psychophysical designs\textsuperscript{24,28,30,31,43}
(Figures 2A and 3A), we found that perceptual history facilitates
post-perceptual processes such as speed of response\textsuperscript{42}
(Figure 2G and 3G) and subjective confidence in humans (Figure 2I).

At the level of individual traits, increased biases toward preceding
choices were associated with reduced sensitivity to external information
(Supplemental Figure 1C-D) and lower metacognitive efficiency. When
investigating how serial dependencies evolve over time, we observed
dynamic changes in the strength of perceptual history (Figures 2 and 3B)
that created wavering biases toward internally- and externally-biased
modes of sensory processing. Between-mode fluctuations may thus provide
a new explanation for ongoing changes in perceptual
performance\textsuperscript{6--11}.

In computational terms, serial dependencies may leverage the temporal
autocorrelation of natural environments\textsuperscript{31,46} to
increase the efficiency of decision-making\textsuperscript{35,43}. Such
temporal smoothing\textsuperscript{46} of sensory inputs may be achieved
by updating dynamic predictions about the world based on the sequence of
noisy perceptual experiences\textsuperscript{22,31}, using algorithms
based on sequential Bayes\textsuperscript{25,42,51} such as
Kalman\textsuperscript{35} or Hierarchical Gaussian
filtering\textsuperscript{54}. At the level of neural mechanisms, the
integration of internal with external information may be realized by
combining feedback from higher levels in the cortical hierarchy with
incoming sensory signals that are fed forward from lower
levels\textsuperscript{56}.

Yet relying too strongly on serial dependencies may come at a cost: When
accumulating over time, internal predictions may eventually override
external information, leading to circular and false inferences about the
state of the environment\textsuperscript{57}. Akin to the
wake-sleep-algorithm in machine learning\textsuperscript{58}, bimodal
inference may help to determine whether errors result from external
input or from internally-stored predictions: During internal mode,
sensory processing is more strongly constrained by predictive processes
that auto-encode the agent's environment. Conversely, during external
mode, the network is driven predominantly by sensory
inputs\textsuperscript{18}. Between-mode fluctuations may thus generate
an unambiguous error signal that aligns internal predictions with the
current state of the environment in iterative
test-update-cycles\textsuperscript{58}. On a broader scale, between-mode
fluctuations may thus regulate the balance between feedforward versus
feedback contributions to perception and thereby play a adaptive role in
metacognition and reality monitoring\textsuperscript{59}.

We hypothesized that observers have certain hyperpriors that are apt for
accommodating fluctuations in the predictability of their environment,
i.e., people believe that their world is inherently volatile. To be
Bayes optimal, it is therefore necessary to periodically re-evaluate
posterior beliefs about the parameters that define an internal
generative model of the external sensory environment. One way to do this
is to periodically suspend the precision of prior beliefs and increase
the precision afforded to sensory evidence, thus updating Bayesian
beliefs about model parameters.

The empirical evidence above suggests that the timescale of this
periodic scheduling of evidence accumulation may be scale-invariant.
This means that there may exist a timescale of periodic fluctuations in
precision over every window or length of perceptual decision-making.
Bimodal inference predicts perceptual decisions under a generative model
(based upon a hazard function to model serial dependencies between
subsequent trials) with periodic fluctuations in the precision of
sensory evidence relative to prior beliefs at a particular timescale.
Remarkably, a systematic model comparison based on AIC indicated that a
model with fluctuating precisions has much greater evidence, relative to
a model in the absence of fluctuating precisions. This ad-hoc addition
of oscillations to a normative Bayesian model of evidence
accumulation\textsuperscript{51} allowed us to quantify the dominant
timescale of periodic fluctuations mode at approximately 0.11
1/\(N_{trials}\) in humans and mice that is appropriate for these kinds
of paradigms.

\hypertarget{bimodal-inference-versus-normative-bayesian-evidence-accumulation}{%
\subsection{Bimodal inference versus normative Bayesian evidence
accumulation}\label{bimodal-inference-versus-normative-bayesian-evidence-accumulation}}

Could bimodal inference emerge spontaneously in normative models of
perceptual decision-making? In predictive processing, the relative
precision of prior and likelihood determines their integration into the
posterior that determines the content of perception. At the level of
individual trials, the perceptual impact of internal predictions
generated from perceptual history (prior precision) and external sensory
information (likelihood precision) are thus necessarily anti-correlated.
The same holds for mechanistic models of drift diffusion, which
understand choice history biases as driven by changes in the starting
point\textsuperscript{51} or the drift rate of evidence
accumulation\textsuperscript{32}. Under the former formulation,
perceptual history is bound to have a stronger influence on perception
when less weight is given to incoming sensory evidence, assuming that
the last choice is represented as a starting point bias. The effects of
choice history in normative Bayesian and mechanistic drift diffusion
models can be mapped onto one another via the Bayesian formulation of
drift diffusion\textsuperscript{60}, where the inverse of likelihood
precision determines the amount of noise in the accumulation of new
evidence, and prior precision determines the absolute shift in its
starting point\textsuperscript{60}.

While it is thus clear that the impact of perceptual history and sensory
evidence are anti-correlated \emph{at each individual trial}, we here
introduce anti-phase oscillations as an ad-hoc modification to model
slow fluctuations in prior and likelihood precision that evolve
\emph{over many consecutive trials} and are not mandated by normative
Bayesian or mechanistic drift diffusion models. The bimodal inference
model provides a reasonable explanation of the linked autocorrelations
in stimulus- and history-congruence, as evidenced by formal model
comparison, successful prediction of RTs and confidence as
out-of-training variables, and a qualitative reproduction of our
empirical data from posterior model parameter as evidence against over-
or under-fitting.

Of note, similar non-stationarities have been observed in descriptive
models that assume continuous\textsuperscript{61} or
discrete\textsuperscript{12} changes in the latent states that modulate
perceptual decision-making at slow timescales. A recent computational
study\textsuperscript{62} has used a Hidden Markov model to investigate
perceptual decision-making in the IBL database\textsuperscript{21}. In
analogy to our findings, the authors observed that mice switch between
temporally extended \emph{strategies} that last for more than 100
trials: During \emph{engaged} states, perception was highly sensitive to
external sensory information. During \emph{disengaged} states, in turn,
choice behavior was prone to errors due to enhanced biases toward one of
the two perceptual outcomes\textsuperscript{62}. Despite the conceptual
differences to our approach (discrete states in a Hidden Markov model
that correspond to switches between distinct decision-making
strategies\textsuperscript{62} vs.~gradual changes in mode that emerge
from sequential Bayesian inference and ongoing oscillations in the
impact of external relative to internal information), it is tempting to
speculate that engaged/disengaged states and between-mode fluctuations
might tap into the same underlying phenomenon.

\hypertarget{task-engagement-and-residual-motor-activation-as-alternative-explanations-for-bimodal-inference}{%
\subsection{Task engagement and residual motor activation as alternative
explanations for bimodal
inference}\label{task-engagement-and-residual-motor-activation-as-alternative-explanations-for-bimodal-inference}}

As a functional explanation for bimodal inference, we propose that
perception temporarily disengages from internal predictions to form
stable inferences about the statistical properties of the sensory
environment. Between-mode fluctuations may thus elude circular
inferences that occur when both the causes and the encoding of sensory
stimuli are volatile\textsuperscript{19,57}. By the same token, we
suggest that fluctuations in mode occur at the level of perceptual
processing\textsuperscript{26,30,46,47}, and are not a passive
phenomenon that is primarily driven by factors situated up- or
downstream of sensory analysis.

How does attention relate to phenomenon of between-mode fluctuations?
According to predictive processing, attention corresponds to the
precision afforded to the probability distributions that underlie
perceptual inference\textsuperscript{53}. From this perspective,
fluctuations between external and internal mode can be understood as
ongoing shifts in the attention afforded to either external sensory
information (regulated via likelihood precision) or internal predictions
(regulated via prior precision). When the precision of either likelihood
or prior increases, posterior precision increases, which leads to faster
RTs and higher confidence. Therefore, when defined from the perspective
of predictive processing as the precision afforded to likelihood and
prior\textsuperscript{53}, fluctuations in attention may provide a
plausible explanation for the quadratic relationship of mode to RTs and
confidence (Figure 2H and J; Figure 3I, Figure 4I).

Outside of the predictive processing field, attention is often
understood in the context of task engagement\textsuperscript{63}, which
varies according to the availability of cognitive resources that are
modulated by factors such as tonic arousal, familiarity with the task,
or fatigue\textsuperscript{63}. Our results suggest that internal mode
processing cannot be completely reduced to intervals of low task
engagement: In addition to shorter RTs and elevated confidence, choices
during internal mode were not random or globally biased, but driven by
perceptual history (Supplemental Section). Moreover, our computational
model identified the dominant timescale of between-mode fluctuations at
0.11 1/\(N_{trials}\), which may be compatible with fluctuations in
arousal\textsuperscript{64}, but is faster than to be expected for the
development of task familiarity or fatigue.

However, in interpreting the impact of between-mode fluctuations on
perceptual accuracy, speed of response and confidence, it is important
to consider that global modulators such as tonic arousal are known to
have non-linear effects on task performance\textsuperscript{65}: In
perceptual tasks, performance seems so be highest during mid-level
arousal, whereas low- and high-level arousal lead to reduced accuracy
and slower responses\textsuperscript{65}. This contrasts with the
effects of bimodal inference, where accuracy increases linearly as one
moves from internal to external mode, and responses become faster at
both ends of the mode spectrum.

Of note, high phasic arousal has been shown to suppress biases in
decision-making in humans and mice across
domains\textsuperscript{66--68}, including biases toward perceptual
history\textsuperscript{28} that we implicate in internal mode
processing. While the increase in response speed and history congruence
over time (Supplemental Section 9.4) may argue against insufficient
training as an alternative explanation for internal mode processing, it
may also be indicative of waning arousal. The multiple mechanistic
mappings to RTs and confidence warrant more direct measures of arousal
(such as pupil size\textsuperscript{28,65,66,68--70}, motor
behavior\textsuperscript{69,70}, or neural data\textsuperscript{71}) to
better delineate bimodal inference from fluctuations in global
modulators of task performance.

Residual activation of the motor system may provide another contribution
to serial biases in perceptual choices\textsuperscript{72}. Such
motor-driven priming may lead to errors in randomized psychophysical
designs, resembling the phenomenon that we identify as internally-biased
processing\textsuperscript{73}. Moreover, residual activation of the
motor system may lead to faster responses, and thus constitutes an
alternative explanation for the quadratic relationship of mode with
RTs\textsuperscript{72}. The observation of elevated confidence for
stronger biases toward internal mode speaks against the proposition that
residual activation of the motor system is the primary driver of serial
choice biases, since strong motor-driven priming should lead to frequent
lapses that are typically associated reduced
confidence\textsuperscript{74}. Likewise, perceptual history effects
have repeatedly been replicated in experiments with counter-balanced
stimulus-response mappings\textsuperscript{30: Feigin2021}.

No-response paradigms, in which perceptual decision are inferred from
eye-movements alone, could help to better differentiate perceptual from
motor-related effects. Likewise, video-tracking of response behavior and
neural recording from motor- and premotor, which has recently been
released for the IBL database{[}IBL2023{]}, may provide further insight
into the relation of motor behavior to the perceptual phenomenon of
between-mode fluctuations.

\hypertarget{limitations-and-open-questions}{%
\subsection{Limitations and open
questions}\label{limitations-and-open-questions}}

Our results suggest bimodal inference as a pervasive aspect of
perceptual decision-making in humans and mice. However, a number of
limitations and open questions have to be considered:

First, this work sought to understand whether fluctuations between
internal and external mode, which we initially observed in an experiment
on bistable perception in humans\textsuperscript{19}, represent a
general phenomenon that occurs across a diverse set of perceptual
decision-making tasks. Our analysis of the Confidence
database\textsuperscript{20} therefore collapsed across all available
experiments on binary perceptual decision-making. Individual experiments
differed with respect to the stimuli, the manipulation of difficulty,
the timing of trials, and the way responses were collected, but were
highly comparable with respect to the central variables of stimulus- and
history-congruence (Supplemental Figure S1A-B).

The variability across experiments, which we considered as random
effects in all statistical analyses, enabled us to assess whether
bimodal inference represents a general phenomenon in perceptual
decision-making, but limited the precision at which we were able to
investigate the relation of mode to behavioral variables such as timing,
task difficulty, RT or confidence. This issue is partially resolved by
our analyses of the IBL database, which replicated our findings in an
experiment that was highly standardized with respect to timing, task
difficulty, and behavioral read-out\textsuperscript{21}. It will be an
important task for future research to validate our results on bimodal
inference in a standardized dataset of comparable volume in humans,
which is, to our knowledge, not yet available.

Second, our results point to an attraction of perception toward
preceding choices. Previous work has shown that perceptual
decision-making is concurrently affected by both attractive and
repulsive serial biases that operate on distinct time-scales and serve
complementary functions for sensory
processing\textsuperscript{27,75,76}: Short-term attraction may serve
the decoding of noisy sensory inputs and increase the stability of
perception, whereas long-term repulsion may enable efficient encoding
and sensitivity to change\textsuperscript{27}. In the data analyzed
here, history biases tended to be repetitive (Figure 2A, Figure 3A,
Supplemental Figure S6 and S7), and only 2 of the 66 experiments of the
Confidence database\textsuperscript{20} showed significant alternating
biases (Supplemental Figure S1). However, as we show in Supplemental
Figure S14, fluctuations in both alternating and repeating history
biases generate overlapping autocorrelation curves. Our analysis of
between-mode fluctuations is therefore not tied exclusively to repeating
biases, but accommodates alternating biases as well, such that both may
lead to internally-biased processing and reduced sensitivity to external
sensory information. Future work could apply our approach to paradigms
that boost alternating as opposed to repeating biases, as this would
help to better understand how repetition and alternation are linked in
terms of their computational function and neural
implementation\textsuperscript{27}.

A third open question concerns the computational underpinnings of
bimodal inference. The addition of slow anti-phase oscillations to the
integration of prior and likelihood represents an ad-hoc modification of
a normative Bayesian model of evidence accumulation\textsuperscript{51}.
While the bimodal inference model is supported by formal model
comparison, the successful prediction of out-of-training variables and
the qualitative reproduction of our empirical data in simulations from
posterior model parameters, it is an important task for future research
to test (i), whether between-mode fluctuations can emerge spontaneously
in hierarchical models of Bayesian inference, (ii), whether modes are
continuous\textsuperscript{19} or discrete\textsuperscript{62}, and
(iii), whether bimodal inference can be causally manipulated by
experimental variables. We speculate that between-mode fluctuations may
separate the perceptual contribution of internal predictions and
external sensory data in time, creating unambiguous learning signals
that benefit inference about the precision of prior and likelihood,
respectively. This proposition should be tested empirically by relating
the phenomenon of bimodal inference to performance in, e.g., reversal
learning, probabilistic reasoning, or metacognition.

A final important avenue for further research on bimodal inference is to
elucidate its neurobiological underpinnings. Since between-mode
fluctuations were found in humans and mice, future studies can apply
non-invasive and invasive neuro-imaging and electrophysiology to better
understand the neural mechanisms that generate ongoing changes in mode
in terms of their neuro-anatomy, -chemistry and -circuitry.

Establishing the neural correlates of externally- an internally-biased
modes will enable exiting opportunities to investigate their role for
adaptive perception and decision-making: Causal interventions via
pharmacological challenges, optogenetic manipulations or (non-)invasive
brain stimulation will help to understand whether between-mode
fluctuations are implicated in resolving credit-assignment
problems\textsuperscript{18,77} or in calibrating metacognition and
reality monitoring\textsuperscript{59}. Answers to these questions may
provide new insights into the pathophysiology of hallucinations and
delusions, which have been characterized by an imbalance in the impact
of external versus internal information\textsuperscript{56,78,79} and
are typically associated with metacognitive failures and a departure
from consensual reality\textsuperscript{79}.

which participants made binary perceptual decisions between two
alternatives. We excluded two experiments in which the average
perceptual accuracy fell below 50\%. After excluding these experiments,
our sample consisted of \(21.05\) million trials obtained from 4317
human participants and 66 individual experiments (Supplemental Table 1).

\hypertarget{method-details}{%
\subsection{Method details}\label{method-details}}

\hypertarget{variables-of-interest}{%
\subsubsection{Variables of interest}\label{variables-of-interest}}

\textbf{Primary variables of interest:} We extracted trial-wise data on
the presented stimulus and the associated perceptual decision.
Stimulus-congruent choices were defined by perceptual decisions that
matched the presented stimuli. History-congruent choices were defined by
perceptual choices that matched the perceptual choice at the immediately
preceding trial. The dynamic probabilities of stimulus- and
history-congruence were computed in sliding windows of ±5 trials.

The \emph{mode} of sensory processing was derived by subtracting the
dynamic probability of history-congruence from the dynamic probability
of stimulus-congruence, such that positive values indicate
externally-oriented processing, whereas negative values indicate
internally-oriented processing. When visualizing the relation of the
mode of sensory processing to confidence, RTs or trial duration (see
below), we binned the mode variable in 10\% intervals. We excluded bins
that contained less than 0.5\% of the total number of available
data-points.

\textbf{Secondary variables of interest}: From the Confidence
Database\textsuperscript{20}, we furthermore extracted trial-wise
confidence reports and RTs. Out of the 58 experiments that provide
information on RTs, 46 cued the response by the onset of a response
screen or an additional response cue, whereas 14 allowed participants to
response at any time after stimulus onset. If RTs were available for
both the perceptual decision and the confidence report, we only
extracted the RT associated with the perceptual decision. To enable
comparability between studies, we normalized RTs and confidence reports
within individual studies using the \emph{scale} R function. If not
available for a particular study, RTs were treated as missing variables.
From the IBL database\textsuperscript{21}, we extracted trial durations
(TDs) as defined by interval between stimulus onset and feedback, which
represents a coarse measure of RT\textsuperscript{21}.

\textbf{Exclusion criteria for individual data-points:} For
non-normalized data (TDs from the IBL database\textsuperscript{21};
d-prime, meta-dprime and M-ratio from the Confidence
database\textsuperscript{20} and simulated confidence reports), we
excluded data-points that differed from the median by more than 3 x MAD
(median absolute distance\textsuperscript{49}). For normalized data (RTs
and confidence reports from the Confidence
database\textsuperscript{20}), we excluded data-points that differed
from the mean by more than 3 x SD (standard deviation).

\hypertarget{control-variables}{%
\subsubsection{Control variables}\label{control-variables}}

Next to the sequence of presented stimuli, we assessed the
autocorrelation of task difficulty as an alternative explanation for any
autocorrelation in stimulus- and history-congruence. In the Confidence
Database\textsuperscript{20}, 21 of the 66 included experiments used
fixed difficulty levels, whereas 45 manipulated difficulty levels within
participants. Difficulty was manipulated via noise masks, contrast,
luminance, presentation time, or stimulus probability for gabors, dot
coherence for random dot kinematograms, difference in elements and set
size for comparisons of numerosity, difference in clicks for auditory
discrimination, temporal distance for meta-contrast masking, and amount
of self-motion for proprioception. We treated task difficulty as a
missing variable for the experiments that fixed it at the
participant-level, as this precluded the computation of autocorrelation
curves. In analogy to RTs and confidence, difficulty levels were
normalized within individual studies. For the IBL
Database\textsuperscript{21}, task difficulty was defined by the
contrast of the presented grating.

\hypertarget{autocorrelations}{%
\subsubsection{Autocorrelations}\label{autocorrelations}}

For each participant, trial-wise autocorrelation coefficients were
estimated using the R-function \emph{acf} with a maximum lag defined by
the number of trials available per subject. Autocorrelation coefficients
are displayed against the lag (in numbers of trials, ranging from 1 to
20) relative to the index trial (t = 0; Figure 2B-C, 3B-C and 4B-C). To
account for spurious autocorrelations that occur due to imbalances in
the analyzed variables, we estimated autocorrelations for randomly
permuted data (100 iterations). For group-level autocorrelations, we
computed the differences between the true autocorrelation coefficients
and the mean autocorrelation observed for randomly permuted data and
averaged across participants.

At a given trial, group-level autocorrelation coefficients were
considered significant when linear mixed effects modeling indicated that
the difference between real and permuted autocorrelation coefficients
was above zero at an alpha level of 0.05\%. To test whether the
autocorrelation of stimulus- and history-congruence remained significant
when controlling for task difficulty and the sequence of presented
stimuli, we added the respective autocorrelation as an additional factor
to the linear mixed effects model that computed the group-level
statistics (see also \emph{Mixed effects modeling}).

To assess autocorrelations at the level of individual participants, we
counted the number of subsequent trials (starting at the first trial
after the index trial) for which less than 50\% of the permuted
autocorrelation coefficients exceeded the true autocorrelation
coefficient. For example, a count of zero indicates that the true
autocorrelation coefficients exceeded \emph{less than 50\%} of the
autocorrelation coefficients computed for randomly permuted data at the
first trial following the index trial. A count of five indicates that,
for the first five trials following the index trial, the true
autocorrelation coefficients exceeded \emph{more than 50\%} of the
respective autocorrelation coefficients for the randomly permuted data;
at the 6th trial following the index trial, however, \emph{less than
50\%} of the autocorrelation coefficients exceeded the respective
permuted autocorrelation coefficients.

\hypertarget{spectral-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Spectral analysis}\label{spectral-analysis}}

We used the R function \emph{spectrum} to compute the spectral densities
for the dynamic probabilities of stimulus- and history-congruence as
well as the phase (i.e., frequency-specific shift between the two
time-series ranging from 0 to \(2*\pi\)) and squared coherence
(frequency-specific variable that denotes the degree to which the shift
between the two time-series in constant, ranging from 0 to 100\%).
Periodograms were smoothed using modified Daniell smoothers at a width
of 50.

Since the dynamic probabilities of history- and stimulus-congruence were
computed using a sliding windows of ±5 trials (i.e., intervals
containing a total of 11 trials), we report the spectral density,
coherence and phase for frequencies below 1/11 1/\(N_{trials}\).
Spectral densities have one value per subject and frequency (data shown
in Figures 2D and 3D). To assess the relation between stimulus- and
history-congruence in this frequency range, we report average phase and
average squared coherence for all frequencies below 1/11
1/\(N_{trials}\) (i.e., one value per subject; data shown in Figure 2E-F
and 3E-F).

Since the data extracted from the Confidence
Database\textsuperscript{20} consist of a large set of individual
studies that differ with respect to inter-trial intervals, we defined
the variable \emph{frequency} in the dimension of cycles per trial
1/\(N_{trials}\) rather than cycles per second (Hz). For consistency, we
chose 1/\(N_{trials}\) as the unit of frequency for the IBL
database\textsuperscript{21} as well.

\hypertarget{quantification-and-statistical-procedures}{%
\subsection{Quantification and statistical

All aggregate data are reported and displayed with errorbars as mean ±
standard error of the mean.

\hypertarget{mixed-effects-modeling}{%
\subsubsection{Mixed effects modeling}\label{mixed-effects-modeling}}

Unless indicated otherwise, we performed group-level inference using the
R-packages \emph{lmer} and \emph{afex} for linear mixed effects modeling
and \emph{glmer} with a binomial link-function for logistic regression.
We compared models based on AIC. To account for variability between the
studies available from the Confidence Database\textsuperscript{20},
mixed modeling was conducted using random intercepts defined for each
study. To account for variability across experimental session within the
IBL database\textsuperscript{21}, mixed modeling was conducted using
random intercepts defined for each individual session. When multiple
within-participant datapoints were analyzed, we estimated random
intercepts for each participant that were \emph{nested} within the
respective study of the Confidence database\textsuperscript{20}. By
analogy, for the IBL database\textsuperscript{21}, we estimated random
intercepts for each session that were nested within the respective
mouse. We report \(\beta\) values referring to the estimates provided by
mixed effects modeling, followed by the respective T statistic (linear
models) or z statistic (logistic models).

The effects of stimulus- and history-congruence on RTs and confidence
reports (Figure 2, 3 and 4, subpanels G-I) were assessed in linear mixed
effects models that tested for main effects of both stimulus- and
history-congruence as well as the between-factor interaction. Thus, the
significance of any effect of history-congruence on RTs and confidence
reports was assessed while controlling for the respective effect of
stimulus-congruence (and vice versa).

\hypertarget{psychometric-function}{%
\subsubsection{Psychometric function}\label{psychometric-function}}

We obtained psychometric curves by fitting the following error function
to the behavioral data:

\begin{equation}
y_p = \gamma + (1 - \gamma - \delta) *  (erf(\frac{s_w + \mu}{t}) + 1) / 2
\end{equation}

We used the Broyden--Fletcher--Goldfarb--Shanno algorithm in maximum
likelihood estimation\textsuperscript{80} to predict individual choices
\(y\) (outcome A: \(y = 0\); outcome B: \(y = 1\)) from the choice
probability \(y_p\). In humans, we computed \(s_w\) by multiplying the
inputs \(s\) (stimulus A: 0; outcome B: 1) with the task difficulty
\(D_b\) (binarized across 7 levels):

\begin{equation}
s_w = (s - 0.5) * D_b
\end{equation}

In mice, \(s_w\) was defined by the respective stimulus contrast in the
two hemifields:

\begin{equation}
s_w = Contrast_{Right} - Contrast_{Left}
\end{equation}

Parameters of the psychometric error function were fitted using the
R-package \emph{optimx}\textsuperscript{80}. The psychometric error
function was defined via the parameters \(\gamma\) (lower lapse; lower
bound = 0, upper bound = 0.5), \(\delta\) (upper lapse; lower bound = 0,
upper bound = 0.5), \(\mu\) (bias; lower bound humans = -5; upper bound
humans = 5, lower bound mice = -0.5, upper bound mice = 0.5) and
threshold \(t\) (lower bound humans = 0.5, upper bound humans = 25;
lower bound mice = 0.01, upper bound mice = 1.5).

\hypertarget{computational-modeling}{%
\subsubsection{Computational modeling}\label{computational-modeling}}

\textbf{Model definition}: Our modeling analysis is an extension of a
model proposed by Glaze et al.\textsuperscript{51}, who defined a
normative account of evidence accumulation for decision-making. In this
model, trial-wise choices are explained by applying Bayes theorem to
infer moment-by-moment changes in the state of environment from
trial-wise noisy observations across trials.

Following Glaze et al.\textsuperscript{51}, we applied Bayes rule to
compute the posterior evidence for the two alternative choices (i.e.,
the log posterior ratio \(L\)) from the sensory evidence available at
time-point \(t\) (i.e., the log likelihood ratio \(LLR\)) with the prior
probability \(\psi\), weighted by the respective precision terms
\(\omega_{LLR}\) and \(\omega_{\psi}\):

\begin{equation}
L_t = LLR_t * \omega_{LLR} + \psi_t(L_{t-1}, H) * \omega_{\psi}
\end{equation}

In the trial-wise design studied here, a transition between the two
states of the environment (i.e., the sources generating the noisy
observations available to the participant) can occur at any time.
Despite the random nature of the psychophysical paradigms studied
here\textsuperscript{20,21}, humans and mice showed significant biases
toward preceding choices (Figure 2A and 3A). We thus assumed that the
prior probability of the two possible outcomes depends on the posterior
choice probability at the preceding trial and the hazard rate \(H\)
assumed by the participant. Following Glaze et al.\textsuperscript{51},
the prior \(\psi\) is thus computed as follows:

\begin{equation}
\psi_t(L_{t-1}, H)  = L_{t-1} + log(\frac{1-H}{H} + exp(-L_{t-1})) - log(\frac{1-H}{H} + exp(L_{t-1}))
\end{equation}

In this model, humans, mice and simulated agents make perceptual choices
based on noisy observations \(u\). The are computed by applying a
sensitivity parameter \(\alpha\) to the content of external sensory
information \(s\). For humans, we defined the input \(s\) by the two
alternative states of the environment (stimulus A: \(s = 0\); stimulus
B: \(s = 1\)), which generated the observations \(u\) through a sigmoid
function that applied a sensitivity parameter \(\alpha\):

\begin{equation}
u_t = \frac{1}{1+exp(-\alpha*(s_t-0.5))}
\end{equation}

In mice, the inputs \(s\) were defined by the respective stimulus
contrast in the two hemifields:

\begin{equation}
s_t = Contrast_{Right} - Contrast_{Left}
\end{equation}

As in humans, we derived the input \(u\) by applying a sigmoid function
with a sensitivity parameter \(\alpha\) to input \(s\):

\begin{equation}
u_t = \frac{1}{1 + exp(-\alpha * s_t)}
\end{equation}

For humans, mice and in simulations, the log likelihood ratio \(LLR\)
was computed from \(u\) as follows:

\begin{equation}
LLR_t = log(\frac{u_t}{1-u_t})
\end{equation}

To allow for long-range autocorrelation in stimulus- and
history-congruence (Figure 2B and 3B), our modeling approach differed
from Glaze et al.\textsuperscript{51} in that it allowed for systematic
fluctuation in the impact of sensory information (i.e., \(LLR\)) and the
prior probability of choices \(\psi\) on the posterior probability
\(L\). This was achieved by multiplying the log likelihood ratio and the
log prior ratio with coherent anti-phase fluctuations according to
\(\omega_{LLR} = a_{LLR} * sin(f * t + phase) + 1\) and
\(\omega_{\psi} = a_{\psi} * sin(f * t + phase + \pi) + 1\).

\textbf{Model fitting}: In model fitting, we predicted the trial-wise
choices \(y_t\) (option A: 0; option B: 1) from inputs \(s\). To this
end, we minimized the log loss between \(y_t\) and the choice
probability \(y_{p t}\) in the unit interval. \(y_{p t}\) was derived
from \(L_t\) using a sigmoid function defined by the inverse decision
temperature \(\zeta\):

\begin{equation}
y_{p t} = \frac{1}{1 + exp(-\zeta * L_t)}
\end{equation}

This allowed us to infer the free parameters \(H\) (lower bound = 0,
upper bound = 1; human posterior = \(0.45\) ±
\(\ensuremath{4.8\times 10^{-5}}\); mouse posterior = \(0.46\) ±
\(\ensuremath{2.97\times 10^{-4}}\)), \(\alpha\) (lower bound = 0, upper

\(\ensuremath{1.68\times 10^{-5}}\); mouse posterior = \(0.11\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.63\times 10^{-4}}\)), \(p\) (lower bound = 0, upper

\(2.72 ± \ensuremath{4.41\times 10^{-4}}\); mouse posterior = \(2.83\) ±

± \(\ensuremath{1.95\times 10^{-4}}\); mouse posterior = \(4.82\) ±
\(\ensuremath{3.03\times 10^{-3}}\)) using maximum likelihood estimation
with the Broyden--Fletcher--Goldfarb--Shanno algorithm as implemented in
the R-function \emph{optimx}\textsuperscript{80} (see Supplemental Table
T2 for a description of our model parameters).

We validated the bimodal inference model in three steps: a formal model
comparison to reduced models based on AIC (Figure 1F-G; Supplemental
Figure S9), the prediction of within-training (stimulus- and
history-congruence) as well as out-of-training variables (RT and
confidence), and a qualitative reproduction of the empirical data from
model simulations based on estimated parameters (Figure 4).

\textbf{Model comparison.} We assessed the following model space based
on AIC:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The full \emph{bimodal inference model} (M1; Figure 1F) incorporates
  the influence of sensory information according to the parameter
  \(\alpha\) (likelihood); the integration of evidence across trials
  according to the parameter \(H\) (prior); anti-phase oscillations in
  between likelihood and prior precision according to \(\omega_{LLR}\)
  and \(\omega_{\psi}\) with parameters \(a_{LLR}\) (amplitude
  likelihood fluctuation), \(a_{\psi}\) (amplitude prior fluctuation),
  \(f\) (frequency) and \(p\) (phase).
\item
  The \emph{likelihood-oscillation-only model} (M2; Figure 1G)
  incorporates the influence of sensory information according to
  parameter \(\alpha\) (likelihood); the integration of evidence across
  trials according to parameter \(H\) (prior); oscillations in
  likelihood precision according to \(\omega_{LLR}\) with parameters
  \(a_{LLR}\) (amplitude likelihood fluctuation), \(f\) (frequency) and
  \(p\) (phase).
\item
  The \emph{prior-oscillation-only model} (M3; Figure 1G) incorporates
  the influence of sensory information according to parameter \(\alpha\)
  (likelihood); the integration of evidence across trials according to
  parameter \(H\) (prior); oscillations in the prior precision according
  to \(\omega_{\psi}\) with parameters \(a_{\psi}\) (amplitude prior
  fluctuation), \(f\) (frequency) and \(p\) (phase). Please note that
  all models M1-3 lead to shifts in the relative precision of likelihood
  and prior.
\item
  The \emph{normative-evidence-accumulation} (M4; Figure 1G)
  incorporates the influence of sensory information according to
  parameter \(\alpha\) (likelihood); the integration of evidence across
  trials according to parameter \(H\) (prior), There are no additional
  oscillations. Model M4 thus corresponds to the model proposed by Glaze
  et al.~and captures normative evidence accumulation in unpredictable
  environments using a Bayesian update scheme\textsuperscript{51}. The
  comparison against M4 tests the null hypothesis that fluctuations in
  mode emerge from a normative Bayesian model without the ad-hoc
  addition of oscillations as in models M1-3.
\item
  The \emph{no-evidence-accumulation} (M5; Figure 1G) incorporates the
  influence of sensory information according to parameter \(\alpha\)
  (likelihood). The model lacks integration of evidence across trials
  (flat prior) and oscillations. The comparison against M5 tests the
  null hypothesis that observers do not use prior information derived
  from serial dependency in perception.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Prediction of within-training and out-of-training variables.} To
validate our model, we correlated individual posterior parameter
estimates with the respective conventional variables. As a sanity check,
we tested (i), whether the estimated hazard rate \(H\) correlated
negatively with the frequency of history-congruent choices and, (ii),
whether the estimated sensitivity to sensory information \(\alpha\)
correlated positively with the frequency of stimulus-congruent choices.
In addition, we tested whether the posterior decision certainty (i.e..
the absolute of the log posterior ratio) correlated negatively with RTs
and positively with confidence. This allowed us to assess whether our
model could explain aspects of the data it was not fitted to (i.e., RTs
and confidence).

\textbf{Simulations.} Finally, we used simulations (Figure 4,
Supplemental Figures S10-13) to show that all model components,
including the anti-phase oscillations governed by \(a_{\psi}\),
\(a_{LLR}\), \(f\) and \(p\), were necessary for our model to reproduce
the characteristics of the empirical data. This enabled us to assess
over- or under-fitting in the bimodal inference model and all reduced
models M2-M5. We used the posterior model parameters observed for humans
(\(H\), \(\alpha\), \(a_{\psi}\), \(a_{LLR}\), \(f\), \(p\) and
\(\zeta\)) to define individual parameters for simulation in 4317
simulated participants (i.e., equivalent to the number of human
participants). For each participant, the number of simulated trials was
drawn at random between 300 to 700. Inputs \(s\) were drawn at random
for each trial, such that the sequence of inputs to the simulation did
not contain any systematic seriality. Noisy observations \(u\) were
generated by applying the posterior parameter \(\alpha\) to inputs
\(s\), thus generating stimulus-congruent choices in \(71.36\) ±
\(\ensuremath{2.6\times 10^{-3}}\)\% of trials. Choices were simulated
based on the trial-wise choice probabilities \(y_{p}\) obtained from our
model. Simulated data were analyzed in analogy to the human and mouse
data. As a substitute of subjective confidence, we computed the absolute
of the trial-wise log posterior ratio \(|L|\) (i.e., the posterior
decision certainty).

\textbf{Figure 1. Concept.}

A. In binary perceptual decision-making, a participant is presented with
stimuli from two categories (A vs.~B; dotted line) and reports
consecutive perceptual choices via button presses (sold line). All
panels below refer to these stimulated example data.

B. When the response matches the external stimulus information (i.e.,
overlap between dotted and solid line in panel A), perceptual choices
are \emph{stimulus-congruent} (red line). When the response matches the
response at the preceding trial, perceptual choices are
\emph{history-congruent} (blue line).

C. The dynamic probabilities of stimulus- and history-congruence (i.e.,
computed in sliding windows of ±5 trials) fluctuate over time.

D. The \emph{mode} of perceptual processing is derived by computing the
difference between the dynamic probabilities of stimulus- and
history-congruence. Values above 0\% indicate a bias toward external
information, whereas values below 0\% indicate a bias toward internal
information.

E. In computational modeling, internal mode is caused by an enhanced
impact of perceptual history. This causes the posterior (black line) to
be close to the prior (blue line). Conversely, during external mode, the
posterior is close to the sensory information (log likelihood ratio, red
line).

F. The bimodal inference model (M1) explains fluctuations between
externally- and externally-biased modes (left panel) by two interacting
factors: a normative accumulation of evidence according to parameters
\(H\) (middle panel), and anti-phase oscillations in the precision terms
\(\omega_{LLR}\) and \(\omega_{\psi}\) (right panel).

G. The control models M2-M5 were constructed by successively removing
the anti-phase oscillations and the integration of information from the
bimodal inference model. Please note that the
normative-evidence-accumulation-model (M4) corresponds to the model
proposed by Glaze et al.\textsuperscript{51}. In the
no-evidence-accumulation model (M5), perceptual decisions depend only on
likelihood information (flat priors).

\includegraphics{modes_mouse_rev1b_clean_files/figure-latex/Figure_2-1.pdf}

\textbf{Figure 2. Internal and external modes in human perceptual
decision-making.}

A. In humans, perception was stimulus-congruent in 73.46\% ± 0.15\% (in
red) and history-congruent in 52.7\% ± 0.12\% of trials (in blue; upper
panel). History-congruent perceptual choices were more frequent when
perception was stimulus-incongruent (i.e., on \emph{error} trials; lower
panel), indicating that history effects impair performance in randomized
psychophysical designs.

B. Relative to randomly permuted data, we found highly significant
autocorrelations of stimulus-congruence and history-congruence (dots
indicate intercepts \(\neq\) 0 in trial-wise linear mixed effects
modeling at p \textless{} 0.05). Across trials, the autocorrelation
coefficients were best fit by an exponential function (adjusted \(R^2\)
for stimulus-congruence: 0.53; history-congruence: 0.72) as compared to
a linear function (adjusted \(R^2\) for stimulus-congruence: 0.53;
history-congruence: 0.51), decaying at a rate of \(\gamma\) =
\(\ensuremath{-1.92\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{4.5\times 10^{-4}}\)
(T(\(\ensuremath{6.88\times 10^{4}}\)) = \(-4.27\), p =
\(\ensuremath{1.98\times 10^{-5}}\)) for stimulus-congruence and at a
rate of \(\gamma\) = \(\ensuremath{-6.11\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{5.69\times 10^{-4}}\)
(T(\(\ensuremath{6.75\times 10^{4}}\)) = \(-10.74\), p =
\(\ensuremath{7.18\times 10^{-27}}\)) for history-congruence.

C. Here, we depict the number of consecutive trials at which
autocorrelation coefficients exceeded the respective autocorrelation of
randomly permuted data within individual participants. For
stimulus-congruence (upper panel), the lag of positive autocorrelation
amounted to \(3.24\) ± \(\ensuremath{2.39\times 10^{-3}}\) on average,
showing a peak at trial t+1 after the index trial. For
history-congruence (lower panel), the lag of positive autocorrelation
amounted to \(4.87\) ± \(\ensuremath{3.36\times 10^{-3}}\) on average,
peaking at trial t+2 after the index trial.

D. The smoothed probabilities of stimulus- and history-congruence
(sliding windows of ±5 trials) fluctuated as a scale-invariant process
with a 1/f power law, i.e., at power densities that were inversely
proportional to the frequency.

E. The distribution of phase shift between fluctuations in stimulus- and
history-congruence peaked at half a cycle (\(\pi\) denoted by dotted
line).

F. The average squared coherence between fluctuations in stimulus- and
history-congruence (black dotted line) amounted to \(6.49\) ±
\(\ensuremath{2.07\times 10^{-3}}\)\%

G. We observed faster RTs for both stimulus-congruence (as opposed to
stimulus-incongruence, \(\beta\) = \(-0.14\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.6\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.99\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-85.84\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\)) and
history-congruence (\(\beta\) = \(\ensuremath{-9.56\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.37\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.98\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-6.97\), p =
\(\ensuremath{3.15\times 10^{-12}}\)).

H. The mode of perceptual processing (i.e., the difference between the
smoothed probability of stimulus- vs.~history-congruence) showed a
quadratic relationship to RTs, with faster RTs for stronger biases
toward both external sensory information and internal predictions
provided by perceptual history (\(\beta_2\) = \(-19.86\) ± \(0.52\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.98\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-38.43\), p =
\(\ensuremath{5\times 10^{-323}}\)). The horizontal and vertical dotted
lines indicate maximum RT and the associated mode, respectively.

I. Confidence was enhanced for both stimulus-congruence (as opposed to
stimulus-incongruence, \(\beta\) = \(0.48\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.38\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.06\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(351.54\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\)) and
history-congruence (\(\beta\) = \(0.04\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.18\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.06\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(36.85\), p =
\(\ensuremath{3.25\times 10^{-297}}\)).

J. In analogy to RTs, we found a quadratic relationship between the mode
of perceptual processing and confidence, which increased when both
externally- and internally-biased modes grew stronger (\(\beta_2\) =
\(39.3\) ± \(0.94\), T(\(\ensuremath{2.06\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(41.95\),
p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\)). The horizontal and vertical dotted lines indicate minimum
confidence and the associated mode, respectively.

\textbf{Figure 3. Internal and external modes in mouse perceptual
decision-making.}

A. In mice, 81.37\% ± 0.3\% of trials were stimulus-congruent (in red)
and 54.03\% ± 0.17\% of trials were history-congruent (in blue; upper
panel). History-congruent perceptual choices were not a consequence of
the experimental design, but a source of error, as they were more
frequent on stimulus-incongruent trials (lower panel).

B. Relative to randomly permuted data, we found highly significant
autocorrelations of stimulus-congruence and history-congruence (dots
indicate intercepts \(\neq\) 0 in trial-wise linear mixed effects
modeling at p \textless{} 0.05). Please note that the negative
autocorrelation of stimulus-congruence at trial 2 was a consequence of
the experimental design (Supplemental Figure 2D-F). As in humans,
autocorrelation coefficients were best fit by an exponential function
(adjusted \(R^2\) for stimulus-congruence: \(0.44\); history-congruence:
\(0.52\)) as compared to a linear function (adjusted \(R^2\) for
stimulus-congruence: \(\ensuremath{3.16\times 10^{-3}}\);
history-congruence: \(0.26\)), decaying at a rate of \(\gamma\) =
\(\ensuremath{-6.2\times 10^{-4}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{5.93\times 10^{-4}}\)
(T(\(\ensuremath{3.55\times 10^{4}}\)) = \(-1.05\), p = \(0.3\)) for
stimulus-congruence and at a rate of \(\gamma\) =
\(\ensuremath{-6.7\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{5.94\times 10^{-4}}\)
(T(\(\ensuremath{3.69\times 10^{4}}\)) = \(-11.27\), p =
\(\ensuremath{2.07\times 10^{-29}}\)) for history-congruence.

C. For stimulus-congruence (upper panel), the lag of positive
autocorrelation was longer in comparison to humans (4.59 ± 0.06 on
average). For history-congruence (lower panel), the lag of positive
autocorrelation was slightly shorter relative to humans (2.58 ± 0.01 on
average, peaking at trial t+2 after the index trial).

D. In mice, the dynamic probabilities of stimulus- and
history-congruence (sliding windows of ±5 trials) fluctuated as a
scale-invariant process with a 1/f power law.

E. The distribution of phase shift between fluctuations in stimulus- and
history-congruence peaked at half a cycle (\(\pi\) denoted by dotted
line).

F. The average squared coherence between fluctuations in stimulus- and
history-congruence (black dotted line) amounted to 3.45 ± 0.01\%.

G. We observed shorter trial durations (TDs) for stimulus-congruence (as
opposed to stimulus-incongruence, \(\beta\) = \(-1.12\) ±
\(\ensuremath{8.53\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.34\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-131.78\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\)), but
longer TDs for history-congruence (\(\beta\) = \(0.06\) ±

T(\(\ensuremath{1.34\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(8.52\), p =
\(\ensuremath{1.58\times 10^{-17}}\)).

H. TDs decreased monotonically for stronger biases toward external mode
(\(\beta_1\) = \(\ensuremath{-4.16\times 10^{4}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.29\times 10^{3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.35\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-32.31\), p =
\(\ensuremath{6.03\times 10^{-229}}\)). The horizontal and vertical
dotted lines indicate maximum TD and the associated mode, respectively.

I. For TDs that differed from the median TD by no more than 1.5 x MAD
(median absolute distance\textsuperscript{49}), mice exhibited a
quadratic component in the relationship between the mode of sensory
processing and TDs (\(\beta_2\) = \(\ensuremath{-1.97\times 10^{3}}\) ±
\(843.74\), T(\(\ensuremath{1.19\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-2.34\), p =
\(0.02\)). This explorative post-hoc analysis focuses on trials at which
mice engage more swiftly with the experimental task. The horizontal and

\textbf{Figure 4. Internal and external modes in simulated perceptual
decision-making.}

A. Simulated perceptual choices were stimulus-congruent in 71.36\% ±
0.17\% (in red) and history-congruent in 51.99\% ± 0.11\% of trials (in
blue; T(\(\ensuremath{4.32\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(17.42\), p =
\(\ensuremath{9.89\times 10^{-66}}\); upper panel). Due to the
competition between stimulus- and history-congruence, history-congruent
perceptual choices were more frequent when perception was
stimulus-incongruent (i.e., on \emph{error} trials;
T(\ensuremath{4.32\times 10^{3}}) = 11.19, p =
\(\ensuremath{1.17\times 10^{-28}}\); lower panel) and thus impaired
performance in the randomized psychophysical design simulated here.

B. At the simulated group level, we found significant autocorrelations
in both stimulus-congruence (13 consecutive trials) and
history-congruence (30 consecutive trials).

C. On the level of individual simulated participants, autocorrelation
coefficients exceeded the autocorrelation coefficients of randomly
permuted data within a lag of \(2.46\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.17\times 10^{-3}}\) trials for stimulus-congruence and
\(4.24\) ± \(\ensuremath{1.85\times 10^{-3}}\) trials for
history-congruence.

D. The smoothed probabilities of stimulus- and history-congruence
(sliding windows of ±5 trials) fluctuated as a scale-invariant process
with a 1/f power law, i.e., at power densities that were inversely
proportional to the frequency (power \textasciitilde{} 1/\(f^\beta\);
stimulus-congruence: \(\beta\) = \(-0.81\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.18\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.92\times 10^{5}}\)) = \(-687.58\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\);
history-congruence: \(\beta\) = \(-0.83\) ±

T(\(\ensuremath{1.92\times 10^{5}}\)) = \(-652.11\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\)).

E. The distribution of phase shift between fluctuations in simulated
stimulus- and history-congruence peaked at half a cycle (\(\pi\) denoted
by dotted line). The dynamic probabilities of simulated stimulus- and
history-congruence were therefore were strongly anti-correlated
(\(\beta\) = \(-0.03\) ± \(\ensuremath{8.22\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.12\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-40.52\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\)).

F. The average squared coherence between fluctuations in simulated
stimulus- and history-congruence (black dotted line) amounted to
\(6.49\) ± \(\ensuremath{2.07\times 10^{-3}}\)\%.

G. Simulated confidence was enhanced for stimulus-congruence (\(\beta\)
= \(0.03\) ± \(\ensuremath{1.71\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.03\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(178.39\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\)) and
history-congruence (\(\beta\) = \(0.01\) ±

T(\(\ensuremath{2.03\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(74.18\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\)).

H. In analogy to humans, the simulated data showed a quadratic
relationship between the mode of perceptual processing and posterior
certainty, which increased for stronger external and internal biases
(\(\beta_2\) = \(31.03\) ± \(0.15\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.04\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(205.95\), p < \(\ensuremath{2.2\times 10^{-308}}\)). The
horizontal and vertical dotted lines indicate minimum posterior
certainty and the associated mode, respectively.
