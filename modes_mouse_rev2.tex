\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

Perception is known to cycle through periods of enhanced and reduced
sensitivity to external information. Here, we asked whether such slow
fluctuations arise as a noise-related epiphenomenon of limited
processing capacity or, alternatively, represent a structured mechanism
of perceptual inference. Using two large-scale datasets, we found that
humans and mice alternate between externally- and internally-oriented
modes of sensory analysis. During external mode, perception aligns more
closely with the external sensory information, whereas internal mode is
characterized by enhanced biases toward perceptual history.
Computational modeling indicated that dynamic changes in mode are
enabled by two interlinked factors: (i), the integration of subsequent
inputs over time and, (ii), slow anti-phase oscillations in the
perceptual impact of external sensory information versus internal
predictions that are provided by perceptual history. We propose that
between-mode fluctuations generate unambiguous error signals that enable
optimal inference in volatile environments.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The capacity to respond to changes in the environment is a defining
feature of life\textsuperscript{1--3}. Intriguingly, the ability of
living things to process their surroundings fluctuates considerably over
time\textsuperscript{4,5}. In humans and mice,
perception\textsuperscript{6--12}, cognition\textsuperscript{13} and
memory\textsuperscript{14} cycle through prolonged periods of enhanced
and reduced sensitivity to external information, suggesting that the
brain detaches from the world in recurring intervals that last from
milliseconds to seconds and even minutes\textsuperscript{4}. Yet
breaking from external information is risky, as swift responses to the
environment are often crucial to survival.

What could be the reason for these fluctuations in perceptual
performance\textsuperscript{11}? First, periodic fluctuations in the
ability to parse external information\textsuperscript{11,15,16} may
arise simply due to bandwidth limitations and noise. Second, it may be
advantageous to actively reduce the costs of neural processing by
seeking sensory information only in recurring
intervals\textsuperscript{17}, otherwise relying on random or
stereotypical responses to the external world. Third, spending time away
from the ongoing stream of sensory inputs may also reflect a functional
strategy that facilitates flexible behavior and
learning\textsuperscript{18}: Intermittently relying more strongly on
information acquired from past experiences may enable agents to build up
stable internal predictions about the environment despite an ongoing
stream of external sensory signals\textsuperscript{19}. By the same
token, recurring intervals of enhanced sensitivity to external
information may help to detect changes in both the state of the
environment and the amount of noise that is inherent in sensory
encoding\textsuperscript{19}.

In this work, we sought to elucidate whether periodicities in the
sensitivity to external information represent an epiphenomenon of
limited processing capacity or, alternatively, result from a structured
and adaptive mechanism of perceptual inference. To this end, we analyzed
two large-scale datasets on perceptual decision-making in
humans\textsuperscript{20} and mice\textsuperscript{21}. When less
sensitive to external stimulus information, humans and mice did not
behave more randomly, but showed stronger serial dependencies in their
perceptual choices\textsuperscript{22--33}. These serial dependencies
may be understood as driven by internal predictions that reflect the
autocorrelation of natural environments\textsuperscript{34} and bias
perception toward preceding experiences\textsuperscript{30,31,35}.
Computational modeling indicated that ongoing changes in perceptual
performance may be driven by systematic fluctuations between externally-
and internally-oriented \emph{modes} of sensory analysis. We suggest
that such \emph{bimodal inference} may help to build stable internal
representations of the sensory environment despite an ongoing stream of
sensory information.

\section{Results}\label{results}}

\hypertarget{human-perception-fluctuates-between-epochs-of-enhanced-and-reduced-sensitivity-to-external-information}{%
\subsection{Human perception fluctuates between epochs of enhanced and
reduced sensitivity to external
information}\label{human-perception-fluctuates-between-epochs-of-enhanced-and-reduced-sensitivity-to-external-information}}

We began by selecting 66 studies from the Confidence
Database\textsuperscript{20} that investigated how human participants (N
= 4317) perform binary perceptual decisions (Figure 1A; see Methods for
details on inclusion criteria). As a metric for perceptual performance
(i.e., the sensitivity to external sensory information), we asked
whether the participant's response and the presented stimulus matched
(\emph{stimulus-congruent} choices) or differed from each other
(\emph{stimulus-incongruent} choices; Figure 1B and C) in a total of
\(21.05\) million trials.

In a first step, we asked whether the ability to accurately perceive
sensory stimuli is constant over time or, alternatively, fluctuates in
periods of enhanced and reduced sensitivity to external information. We
found perception to be stimulus-congruent in 73.46\% ± 0.15\% of trials
(mean ± standard error of the mean; Figure 2A), which was highly
consistent across the selected studies (Supplemental Figure S1A). In
line with previous work\textsuperscript{8}, we found that the
probability of stimulus-congruence was not independent across successive
trials: At the group level, stimulus-congruent perceptual choices were
significantly autocorrelated for up to 15 trials (Figure 2B),
controlling for task difficulty and the sequence of presented stimuli
(Supplemental Figure 2A-B).

At the level of individual participants, the autocorrelation of
stimulus-congruence exceeded the respective autocorrelation of randomly
permuted data within an interval of \(3.24\) ±
\(\ensuremath{2.39\times 10^{-3}}\) trials (Figure 2C). In other words,
if a participant's experience was congruent (or incongruent) with the
external stimulus information at a given trial, her perception was more
likely to remain stimulus-congruent (or -incongruent) for approximately
3 trials into the future. The autocorrelation of stimulus-congruence was
corroborated by logistic regression models that successfully predicted
the stimulus-congruence of perception at the index trial \(t = 0\) from
the stimulus-congruence at the preceding trials within a lag of 16
trials (Supplemental Figure S3).

These results confirm that the ability to process sensory signals is not
constant over time but unfolds in multi-trial epochs of enhanced and
reduced sensitivity to external information\textsuperscript{8}. As a
consequence of this autocorrelation, the dynamic probability of
stimulus-congruent perception (i.e., computed in sliding windows of ± 5
trials; Figure 1C) fluctuated considerably within participants (average
minimum: 35.46\% ± 0.22\%, maximum: 98.27\% ± 0.07\%). In line with
previous findings\textsuperscript{9}, such fluctuations in the
sensitivity to external information had a power density that was
inversely proportional to the frequency in the slow
spectrum\textsuperscript{11} (power \textasciitilde{} 1/\(f^\beta\),
\(\beta\) = \(-1.32\) ± \(\ensuremath{3.14\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.84\times 10^{5}}\)) = \(-419.48\), p = \(0\); Figure
2D). This feature, which is also known as a \emph{1/f power
law}\textsuperscript{36,37}, represents a characteristic of scale-free
fluctuations in complex dynamic systems such as the
brain\textsuperscript{38} and the cognitive processes it
entertains\textsuperscript{9,10,13,39,40}.

\hypertarget{humans-fluctuate-between-external-and-internal-modes-of-sensory-processing}{%
\subsection{Humans fluctuate between external and internal modes of
sensory
processing}\label{humans-fluctuate-between-external-and-internal-modes-of-sensory-processing}}

In a second step, we sought to explain why perception cycles through
periods of enhanced and reduced sensitivity to external
information\textsuperscript{4}. We reasoned that observers may
intermittently rely more strongly on internal information, i.e., on
predictions about the environment that are constructed from previous
experiences\textsuperscript{19,31}.

In perception, \emph{serial dependencies} represent one of the most
basic internal predictions that cause perceptual decisions to be
systematically biased toward preceding choices\textsuperscript{22--33}.
Such effects of perceptual history mirror the continuity of the external
world, in which the recent past often predicts the near
future\textsuperscript{30,31,34,35,41}. Therefore, as a metric for the
perceptual impact of internal information, we computed whether the
participant's response at a given trial matched or differed from her
response at the preceding trial (\emph{history-congruent} and
\emph{history-incongruent perception}, respectively; Figure 1B and C).

First, we confirmed that perceptual history played a significant role in
perception despite the ongoing stream of external information. With a
global average of 52.7\% ± 0.12\% history-congruent trials, we found a
small but highly significant perceptual bias towards preceding
experiences (\(\beta\) = \(16.18\) ± \(1.07\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.09\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(15.07\), p =
\(\ensuremath{10^{-46}}\); Figure 2A) that was largely consistent across
studies (Supplemental Figure 1B) and more pronounced in participants who
were less sensitive to external sensory information (Supplemental Figure
1C). Importantly, history-congruence was not a corollary of the sequence
of presented stimuli: History-congruent perceptual choices were more
frequent at trials when perception was stimulus-incongruent (56.03\% ±
0.2\%) as opposed to stimulus-congruent (51.77\% ± 0.11\%, \(\beta\) =
\(-4.26\) ± \(0.21\), T(\(\ensuremath{8.57\times 10^{3}}\)) =
\(-20.36\), p = \(\ensuremath{5.28\times 10^{-90}}\); Figure 2A, lower
panel). Despite being adaptive in autocorrelated real-world
environments\textsuperscript{19,34,35,42}, perceptual history thus
represented a source of bias in the randomized experimental designs
studied here\textsuperscript{24,28,30,31,43}. These serial biases were
effects of choice history, i.e., driven by the experiences reported at
the preceding trial, and could not be attributed to stimulus history,
i.e., to effects of the stimuli presented at the preceding trial
(Supplemental Section 9.1).

Second, we asked whether perception cycles through multi-trial epochs
during which perception is characterized by stronger or weaker biases
toward preceding experiences. In close analogy to stimulus-congruence,
we found history-congruence to be significantly autocorrelated for up to
21 trials (Figure 2B), while controlling for task difficulty and the
sequence of presented stimuli (Supplemental Figure 2A-B). In individual
participants, the autocorrelation of history-congruence was elevated
above randomly permuted data for a lag of \(4.87\) ±
\(\ensuremath{3.36\times 10^{-3}}\) trials (Figure 2C), confirming that
the autocorrelation of history-congruence was not only a group-level
phenomenon. The autocorrelation of history-congruence was corroborated
by logistic regression models that successfully predicted the
history-congruence of perception at an index trial \(t = 0\) from the
history-congruence at the preceding trials within a lag of 17 trials
(Supplemental Figure S3).

Third, we asked whether the impact of internal information fluctuates as
a scale-invariant process with a 1/f power law (i.e., the feature
typically associated with fluctuations in the sensitivity to external
information\textsuperscript{9,10,13,39,40}). The dynamic probability of
history-congruent perception (i.e., computed in sliding windows of ± 5
trials; Figure 1C) varied considerably over time, ranging between a
minimum of 12.77\% ± 0.14\% and a maximum 92.23\% ± 0.14\%. In analogy
to stimulus-congruence, we found that history-congruence fluctuated as
at power densities that were inversely proportional to the frequency in
the slow spectrum\textsuperscript{11} (power \textasciitilde{}
1/\(f^\beta\), \(\beta\) = \(-1.34\) ±
\(\ensuremath{3.16\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.84\times 10^{5}}\)) = \(-423.91\), p = \(0\); Figure
2D).

Finally, we ensured that fluctuations in stimulus- and
history-congruence are linked to each other. When perceptual choices
were less biased toward external information, participants relied more
strongly on internal information acquired from perceptual history (and
vice versa, \(\beta\) = \(-0.05\) ± \(\ensuremath{5.63\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.1\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-84.21\), p = \(0\),
controlling for fluctuations in general response biases; Supplemental
Section 9.2). Thus, while sharing the 1/f power law characteristic,
fluctuations in stimulus- and history-congruence were shifted against
each other by approximately half a cycle and showed a squared coherence
of \(6.49\) ± \(\ensuremath{2.07\times 10^{-3}}\)\% (Figure 2E and F; we
report the average phase and coherence for frequencies below 0.1
\(1/N_{trials}\); see Methods for details).

In sum, our analyses indicate that perceptual decisions may result from
a competition between external sensory signals with internal predictions
provided by perceptual history. We show that the impact of these
external and internal sources of information is not stable over time,
but fluctuates systematically, emitting overlapping autocorrelation
curves and antiphase 1/f profiles.

These links between stimulus- and history-congruence suggest that the
fluctuations in the impact of external and internal information may be
generated by a unifying mechanism that causes perception to alternate
between two opposing \emph{modes}\textsuperscript{18} (Figure 1D):
During \emph{external mode}, perception is more strongly driven by the
available external stimulus information. Conversely, during
\emph{internal mode}, participants rely more heavily on internal
predictions that are implicitly provided by preceding perceptual
experiences. The fluctuations in the degree of bias toward external
versus internal information created by such \emph{bimodal inference} may
thus provide a novel explanation for ongoing fluctuations in the
sensitivity to external information\textsuperscript{4,5,18}.

\hypertarget{internal-and-external-modes-of-processing-facilitate-response-behavior-and-enhance-confidence-in-human-perceptual-decision-making}{%
\subsection{Internal and external modes of processing facilitate
response behavior and enhance confidence in human perceptual
decision-making}\label{internal-and-external-modes-of-processing-facilitate-response-behavior-and-enhance-confidence-in-human-perceptual-decision-making}}

The above results point to systematic fluctuations in the \emph{decision
variable}\textsuperscript{44} that determines perceptual choices,
causing enhanced sensitivity to external stimulus information during
external mode and increased biases toward preceding choices during
internal mode. As such, fluctuations in mode should influence downstream
aspects of behavior and cognition that operate on the perceptual
decision variable\textsuperscript{44}. To test this hypothesis with
respect to motor behavior and metacognition, we asked how bimodal
inference relates to response times (RTs) and confidence reports.

With respect to RTs, we observed faster responses for stimulus-congruent
as opposed to stimulus-incongruent choices (\(\beta\) = \(-0.14\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.6\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.99\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-85.84\), p = \(0\); Figure
2G). Intriguingly, whilst controlling for the effect of
stimulus-congruence, we found that history-congruent (as opposed to
history-incongruent) choices were also characterized by faster responses
(\(\beta\) = \(\ensuremath{-9.56\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.37\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.98\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-6.97\), p =
\(\ensuremath{3.15\times 10^{-12}}\); Figure 2G).

When analyzing the speed of response against the mode of sensory
processing (Figure 2H), we found that RTs were shorter during
externally-oriented perception (\(\beta_1\) = \(-11.07\) ± \(0.55\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.98\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-20.14\), p =
\(\ensuremath{3.17\times 10^{-90}}\)). Crucially, as indicated by a
quadratic relationship between the mode of sensory processing and RTs
(\(\beta_2\) = \(-19.86\) ± \(0.52\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.98\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-38.43\), p =
\(\ensuremath{5\times 10^{-323}}\)), participants became faster at
indicating their perceptual decision when biases toward both internal
and external mode grew stronger.

In analogy to the speed of response, confidence was higher for
stimulus-congruent as opposed to stimulus-incongruent choices (\(\beta\)
= \(0.04\) ± \(\ensuremath{1.18\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.06\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(36.85\), p =
\(\ensuremath{3.25\times 10^{-297}}\); Figure 2I). Yet whilst
controlling for the effect of stimulus-congruence, we found that
history-congruence also increased confidence (\(\beta\) = \(0.48\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.38\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.06\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(351.54\), p = \(0\); Figure
2I).

When depicted against the mode of sensory processing (Figure 2J),
subjective confidence was indeed enhanced when perception was more
externally-oriented (\(\beta_1\) = \(92.63\) ± \(1\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.06\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(92.89\), p = \(0\)).
Importantly, however, participants were more confident in their
perceptual decision for stronger biases toward both internal and
external mode (\(\beta_2\) = \(39.3\) ± \(0.94\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.06\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(41.95\), p = \(0\)). In
analogy to RTs, subjective confidence thus showed a quadratic
relationship to the mode of sensory processing (Figure 2J).

Consequently, our findings predict that human participants lack full
metacognitive insight into how strongly external signals and internal
predictions contribute to perceptual decision-making. Stronger biases
toward perceptual history thus lead to two seemingly contradictory
effects, more frequent errors (Supplemental Figure 1C) and increasing
subjective confidence (Figure 2I-J). This observation generates an
intriguing prediction regarding the association of between-mode
fluctuations and perceptual metacognition: Metacognitive efficiency
should be lower in individuals who spend more time in internal mode,
since their confidence reports are less predictive of whether the
corresponding perceptual decision is correct. We computed each
participant's M-ratio\textsuperscript{45} (meta-d'/d' = 0.85 ± 0.02) to
probe this hypothesis independently of inter-individual differences in
perceptual performance. Indeed, we found that biases toward internal
information (as defined by the average probability of
history-congruence) were stronger in participants with lower
metacognitive efficiency (\(\beta\) =
\(\ensuremath{-2.98\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{9.82\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{4.14\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(-3.03\), p =
\(\ensuremath{2.43\times 10^{-3}}\)).

In sum, the above results indicate that reporting behavior and
metacognition do not map linearly onto the mode of sensory processing.
Rather, they suggest that slow fluctuations in the respective impact of
external and internal information are most likely to affect perception
at an early level of sensory analysis\textsuperscript{46,47}. Such
low-level processing may thus integrate perceptual history with external
inputs into a decision variable\textsuperscript{44} that influences not
only perceptual choices, but also the speed and confidence at which they
are made.

In what follows, we probe alternative explanations for between-mode
fluctuations, test for the existence of modes in mice, and propose a
predictive processing model that explains fluctuations in mode ongoing
shifts in the precision afforded to external sensory information
relative to internal predictions driven by perceptual history.

\hypertarget{fluctuations-between-internal-and-external-mode-cannot-be-reduced-to-general-response-biases-or-random-choices}{%
\subsection{Fluctuations between internal and external mode cannot be
reduced to general response biases or random
choices}\label{fluctuations-between-internal-and-external-mode-cannot-be-reduced-to-general-response-biases-or-random-choices}}

The core assumption of bimodal inference - that ongoing changes in the
sensitivity to external information are driven by internal predictions
induced via perceptual history - needs to be contrasted against two
alternative hypotheses: When making errors, observers may not engage
with the task and respond stereotypically, i.e., exhibit stronger
general biases toward one of the two potential outcomes, or simply
choose randomly.

Logistic regression confirmed that perceptual history made a significant
contribution to perception (\(\beta\) = \(0.11\) ±
\(\ensuremath{5.79\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(18.53\), p =
\(\ensuremath{1.1\times 10^{-76}}\)) over and above the ongoing stream
of external sensory information (\(\beta\) = \(2.2\) ±
\(\ensuremath{5.87\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(375.11\), p = \(0\)) and
general response biases toward (\(\beta\) = \(15.19\) ± \(0.08\), z =
\(184.98\), p = \(0\)).

When eliminating perceptual history as a predictor of individual choices
at individual trials, Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC\textsuperscript{48}) increased by \(\delta_{AIC}\) =
\(\ensuremath{1.64\times 10^{3}}\) (see Supplemental Figure S4A-B for
parameter- and model-level inference at the level of individual
observers). Likewise, when eliminating slow fluctuations in
history-congruence as a predictor of slow fluctuations in
stimulus-congruence across trials, we observed an increase in AIC by
\(\delta_{AIC}\) = \(\ensuremath{7.06\times 10^{3}}\). These results
provided model-level evidence against the null hypotheses that
fluctuations in stimulus-congruence are driven exclusively by choice
randomness or general response bias (see Supplemental Section 9.2 and
Supplemental Figure S5 for an in-depth assessment of general response
bias).

To confirm that changes in the sensitivity to external information are
indicative of internal mode processing, we estimated full and
history-dependent psychometric curves during internal, external, and
across modes\textsuperscript{21}. If, as we hypothesized, internal mode
processing reflects an enhanced impact of perceptual history, one would
expect a history-dependent increase in biases and lapses as well as a
history-independent increase in threshold. Conversely, if internal mode
processing were driven by random choices, one would expect a
history-independent increase in lapses and threshold, and no change in
bias. In line with our prediction, we found that internal mode
processing was associated with a history-dependent increase in bias and
lapse as well as a history-independent increase in threshold
(Supplemental Section 9.3.1 and Supplemental Figure S6). This confirmed
that internal mode processing is indeed driven by an enhanced impact of
perceptual history.

In line with this, the quadratic relationship between mode and
confidence (Figure 2J) suggested that biases toward internal information
do not reflect a post-perceptual strategy of repeating preceding choices
when the subjective confidence in the perceptual decision is low.
Moreover, while responses became faster with longer exposure to the
experiments of the Confidence database, the frequency of
history-congruent choices increased over time, speaking against the
proposition that participants stereotypically repeat preceding choices
when not yet familiar with the experimental task (Supplemental Section
9.4.1).

Taken together, our results thus argue against recurring intervals of
low task engagement, which may be signaled by stereotypical or random
responses, as an alternative explanation for the phenomenon that we
identify as bimodal inference.

\subsection{Mice fluctuate between external and internal modes of
sensory
processing}\label{mice-fluctuate-between-external-and-internal-modes-of-sensory-processing}}

In a prominent functional explanation for serial
dependencies\textsuperscript{22--28,32,33,46}, perceptual history is
cast as an internal prediction that leverages the temporal
autocorrelation of natural environments for efficient
decision-making\textsuperscript{30,31,34,35,41}. Since this
autocorrelation is one of the most basic features of our sensory world,
fluctuating biases toward preceding perceptual choices should not be a
uniquely human phenomenon.

To test whether externally- and internally-oriented modes of processing
exist beyond the human mind, we analyzed data on perceptual
decision-making in mice that were extracted from the International Brain
Laboratory (IBL) dataset\textsuperscript{21}. We restricted our analyses
to the \emph{basic} task\textsuperscript{21}, in which mice responded to
gratings of varying contrast that appeared either in the left or right
hemifield of with equal probability. We excluded sessions in which mice
did not respond correctly to stimuli presented at a contrast above 50\%
in more than 80\% of trials (see Methods for details), which yielded a
final sample of N = 165 adequately trained mice that went through
\(1.46\) million trials.

We found perception to be stimulus-congruent in 81.37\% ± 0.3\% of
trials (Figure 3A, upper panel). In line with humans, mice were biased
toward perceptual history in 54.03\% ± 0.17\% of trials (T(164) = 23.65,
p = \(\ensuremath{9.98\times 10^{-55}}\); Figure 3A and Supplemental
Figure S1D). Since the \emph{basic} task of the IBL dataset presented
stimuli at random in either the left or right
hemifield\textsuperscript{21}, we expected stronger biases toward
perceptual history to decrease perceptual performance. Indeed,
history-congruent choices were more frequent when perception was
stimulus-incongruent (61.59\% ± 0.07\%) as opposed to stimulus-congruent
(51.81\% ± 0.02\%, T(164) = 31.37, p =
\(\ensuremath{3.36\times 10^{-71}}\); T(164) = 31.37, p =
\(\ensuremath{3.36\times 10^{-71}}\); Figure 3A, lower panel),
confirming that perceptual history was a source of
bias\textsuperscript{24,28,30,31,43} as opposed to a feature of the
experimental paradigm.

At the group level, we found significant autocorrelations in both
stimulus-congruence (42 consecutive trials) and history-congruence (8
consecutive trials; Figure 3B), while controlling for the respective
autocorrelation of task difficulty and external stimulation
(Supplemental Figure 2C-D). In contrast to humans, mice showed a
negative autocorrelation coefficient of stimulus-congruence at trial 2,
which was due to a feature of the experimental design: Errors at a
contrast above 50\% were followed by a high-contrast stimulus at the
same location. Thus, stimulus-incongruent choices on easy trials were
more likely to be followed by stimulus-congruent perceptual choices that
were facilitated by high-contrast visual stimuli\textsuperscript{21}.

At the level of individual mice, autocorrelation coefficients were
elevated above randomly permuted data within a lag of 4.59 ± 0.06 trials
for stimulus-congruence and 2.58 ± 0.01 trials for history-congruence
(Figure 3C). We corroborated these autocorrelations in logistic
regression models that successfully predicted the
stimulus-/history-congruence of perception at the index trial \(t = 0\)
from the stimulus-/history-congruence at the 33 preceding trials for
stimulus-congruence and 8 preceding trials for history-congruence
(Supplemental Figure S3). In analogy to humans, mice showed anti-phase
1/f fluctuations in the sensitivity to internal and external information
(Figure 3D-F).

The above results confirm that fluctuations between internally- and
externally-biased modes generalize to perceptual decision-making in
mice. Following our hypothesis that bimodal inference operates at the
level of perception, we predicted that between-mode fluctuations
modulate a decision variable\textsuperscript{44} that determines not
only perceptual choices, but also downstream aspects of mouse
behavior\textsuperscript{44}. We therefore asked how external and
internal modes relate to the trial duration (TD, a coarse measure of RT
in mice that spans the interval from stimulus onset to
feedback\textsuperscript{21}). Stimulus-congruent (as opposed to
stimulus-incongruent) choices were associated with shorter TDs
(\(\delta\) = \(-262.48\) ± \(17.1\), T(164) = -15.35, p =
\(\ensuremath{1.55\times 10^{-33}}\)), while history-congruent choices
were characterized by longer TDs (\(\delta\) = \(30.47\) ± \(5.57\),
T(164) = 5.47, p = \(\ensuremath{1.66\times 10^{-7}}\); Figure 3G).

Across the full spectrum of the available data, TDs showed a linear
relationship with the mode of sensory processing, with shorter TDs
during external mode (\(\beta_1\) = \(\ensuremath{-4.16\times 10^{4}}\)
± \(\ensuremath{1.29\times 10^{3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.35\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-32.31\), p =
\(\ensuremath{6.03\times 10^{-229}}\), Figure 3H). However, an
explorative post-hoc analysis limited to TDs that differed from the
median TD by no more than 1.5 x MAD (median absolute
distance\textsuperscript{49}) indicated that, when mice engaged with the
task more swiftly, TDs did indeed show a quadratic relationship with the
mode of sensory processing (\(\beta_2\) =
\(\ensuremath{-1.97\times 10^{3}}\) ± \(843.74\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.19\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-2.34\), p = \(0.02\), Figure
3I).

As in humans, it is important to ensure that ongoing changes in the
sensitivity to external information are indeed driven by perceptual
history and cannot be reduced to general choice biases or random
behavior. Logistic regression confirmed a significant effect perceptual
history on perceptual choices (\(\beta\) = \(0.51\) ±
\(\ensuremath{4.49\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(112.84\), p = \(0\)), while
controlling for external sensory information (\(\beta\) = \(2.96\) ±
\(\ensuremath{4.58\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(646.1\), p = \(0\)) and
general response biases toward one of the two outcomes (\(\beta\) =
\(-1.78\) ± \(0.02\), z = \(-80.64\), p = \(0\)). When eliminating
perceptual history as a predictor of individual choices, AIC increased
by \(\delta_{AIC}\) = \(\ensuremath{1.48\times 10^{4}}\), arguing
against the notion that choice randomness and general response bias are
the only determinants of perceptual performance in mice (see
Supplemental Figure S4C-D for parameter- and model-level inference in
individual subjects).

In mice, fluctuations in the strength of history-congruent biases had a
significant effect on stimulus-congruence (\(\beta_1\) = \(-0.12\) ±
\(\ensuremath{7.17\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.34\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-168.39\), p = \(0\)) beyond
the effect of ongoing changes in general response biases (\(\beta_2\) =
\(-0.03\) ± \(\ensuremath{6.94\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.34\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-48.14\), p = \(0\)).
Eliminating the dynamic fluctuations in history-congruence as a
predictor of fluctuations in stimulus-congruence resulted in an increase
in AIC by \(\delta_{AIC}\) = \(\ensuremath{2.8\times 10^{4}}\) (see
Supplemental Section 9.2 and Supplemental Figure S5 for an in-depth
assessment of general response bias).

When fitting full and history-conditioned psychometric curves to the IBL
data\textsuperscript{21}, we observed that internal mode processing was
associated with a history-dependent increase in bias and lapse as well
as a history-independent increase in threshold (Supplemental Section
9.3.2 and Supplemental Figure S7). Over time, the frequency of
history-congruent choices increased alongside stimulus-congruence and
speed of response as mice were exposed to the experiment, arguing
against the proposition that biases toward perceptual history reflected
an unspecific response strategy in mice who were not sufficiently
trained on the IBL task (Supplemental Section 9.4.2 and Supplemental
Figure S8).

In sum, these analyses confirmed that the observed fluctuations in
sensitivity to external sensory information are driven by dynamic
changes in impact of perceptual history and cannot be reduced to general
response bias and random choice behavior.

\subsection{Fluctuations in mode result from coordinated changes in the
impact of external and internal information on
perception}\label{fluctuations-in-mode-result-from-coordinated-changes-in-the-impact-of-external-and-internal-information-on-perception}}

The empirical data presented above indicate that, for both humans and
mice, perception fluctuates between external and modes, i.e.,
multi-trial epochs that are characterized by enhanced sensitivity toward
either external sensory information or internal predictions generated by
perceptual history. Since natural environments typically show high
temporal redundancy\textsuperscript{34}, previous experiences are often
good predictors of new stimuli\textsuperscript{30,31,35,41}. Serial
dependencies may therefore induce autocorrelations in perception by
serving as internal predictions (or \emph{memory}
processes\textsuperscript{9,13}) that actively integrate noisy sensory
information over time\textsuperscript{50}.

Previous work has shown that such internal predictions can be built by
dynamically updating the estimated probability of being in a particular
perceptual state from the sequence of preceding
experiences\textsuperscript{35,46,51}. The integration of sequential
inputs may lead to accumulating effects of perceptual history that
progressively override incoming sensory information, enabling internal
mode processing\textsuperscript{19}. However, since such a process would
lead to internal biases that may eventually become impossible to
overcome\textsuperscript{52}, changes in mode may require ongoing
wave-like fluctuations\textsuperscript{9,13} in the perceptual impact of
external and internal information that occur \emph{irrespective} of the
sequence of previous experiences and temporarily de-couple the decision
variable from implicit internal representations of the
environment\textsuperscript{19}.

Following Bayes' theorem, binary perceptual decisions depend on the log
posterior ratio \(L\) of the two alternative states of the environment
that participants learn about via noisy sensory
information\textsuperscript{51}. We computed the posterior by combining
the sensory evidence available at time-point \(t\) (i.e., the log
likelihood ratio \(LLR\)) with the prior probability \(\psi\), weighted
by the respective precision terms \(\omega_{LLR}\) and
\(\omega_{\psi}\):

\begin{equation}
L_t = LLR_t * \omega_{LLR} + \psi_t(L_{t-1}, H) * \omega_{\psi}
\end{equation}

We derived the prior probability \(\psi\) at timepoint \(t\) from the
posterior probability of perceptual outcomes at timepoint \(L_{t-1}\).
Since a switch between the two states can occur at any time, the effect
of perceptual history varies according to both the sequence of preceding
experiences and the estimated stability of the external environment
(i.e., the \emph{hazard rate} \(H\)\textsuperscript{51}):

\begin{equation}
\psi_t(L_{t-1}, H)  = L_{t-1} + log(\frac{1-H}{H} + exp(-L_{t-1})) - log(\frac{1-H}{H} + exp(L_{t-1}))
\end{equation}

The \(LLR\) was computed from inputs \(s_t\) by applying a sigmoid
function defined by parameter \(\alpha\) that controls the sensitivity
of perception to the available sensory information (see Methods for
details on \(s_t\) in humans and mice):

\begin{equation}
u_t = \frac{1}{1 + exp(-\alpha * s_t)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
LLR_t = log(\frac{u_t}{1-u_t})
\end{equation}

To allow for bimodal inference, i.e., alternating periods of internally-
and externally-biased modes of perceptual processing that occur
irrespective of the sequence of preceding experiences, we assumed that
likelihood and prior vary in their influence on the perceptual decision
according to fluctuations governed by \(\omega_{LLR}\) and
\(\omega_{\psi}\). These anti-phase sine functions (defined by
amplitudes \(a_{LLR/\psi}\), frequency \(f\) and phase \(p\)) determine
the precision afforded to the likelihood and prior\textsuperscript{53}.
The implicit anti-phase fluctuations are mandated by Bayes-optimal
formulations in which inference depends only on the relative values of
prior and likelihood precision (i.e., the Kalman
gain\textsuperscript{54}). As such, \(\omega_{LLR}\) and
\(\omega_{\psi}\) implement a hyperprior\textsuperscript{55} in which
the likelihood and prior precisions are shifted against each other at a
dominant timescale defined by \(f\):

\begin{equation}
\omega_{LLR} = a_{LLR} * sin(f * t + p) + 1
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\omega_{\psi} = a_{\psi} * sin(f * t + p + \pi) + 1
\end{equation}

Finally, a sigmoid transform of the posterior \(L_t\) yields the
probability of observing the perceptual decision \(y_t\) at a
temperature determined by \(\zeta^{-1}\):

\begin{equation}
P(y_t = 1) = 1 - P(y_t = 0) = \frac{1}{1 + exp(-\zeta * L_t)}
\end{equation}

We used a maximum likelihood procedure to fit the bimodal inference
model (M1, Figure 1F) to the behavioral data from the Confidence
database\textsuperscript{20} and the IBL database\textsuperscript{21},
optimizing the parameters \(\alpha\), \(H\), \(amp_{LLR}\),
\(amp_{\psi}\), \(f\), \(p\) and \(\zeta\) (see Methods for details and
Supplemental Table T2 for a summary of the parameters of the bimodal
inference model). We validated our model in three steps:

First, to show that bimodal inference does not emerge spontaneously in
normative Bayesian models of evidence accumulation, but requires the
ad-hoc addition of anti-phase oscillations in prior and likelihood
precision, we compared the bimodal inference model to four control
models (M2-5, Figure 1G). In these models, we successively removed the
anti-phase oscillations (M2-M4) and the integration of information
across trials (M5) from the bimodal inference model and performed a
model comparison based on AIC.

Model M2 (\(AIC_2\) = \(\ensuremath{9.76\times 10^{4}}\) in humans and
\(\ensuremath{4.91\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) and Model M3 (\(AIC_3\) =
\(\ensuremath{1.19\times 10^{5}}\) in humans and
\(\ensuremath{5.95\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) incorporated only
oscillations of either likelihood or prior precision. Model M4
(\(AIC_4\) = \(\ensuremath{1.69\times 10^{5}}\) in humans and
\(\ensuremath{9.12\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) lacked any oscillations of
likelihood and prior precision and corresponded to the normative model
proposed by Glaze et al.\textsuperscript{51}. In model M5 (\(AIC_4\) =
\(\ensuremath{2.01\times 10^{5}}\) in humans and
\(\ensuremath{1.13\times 10^{5}}\) in mice), we furthermore removed the
integration of information across trials, such that perception depended
only in incoming sensory information (Figure 1G).

The bimodal inference model achieved the lowest AIC across the full
model space (\(AIC_1\) = \(\ensuremath{8.16\times 10^{4}}\) in humans
and \(\ensuremath{4.24\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) and was clearly superior
to the normative Bayesian model of evidence accumulation
(\(\delta_{AIC}\) = \(\ensuremath{-8.79\times 10^{4}}\) in humans and
\(\ensuremath{-4.87\times 10^{4}}\) in mice; Supplemental Figure S9).

As a second validation of the bimodal inference model, we tested whether
the posterior model predicted within-training and out-of-training
variables. The bimodal inference model characterizes each subject by a
sensitivity parameter \(\alpha\) (humans: \(\alpha\) = \(0.5\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.12\times 10^{-4}}\); mice: \(\alpha\) = \(1.06\) ±
\(\ensuremath{2.88\times 10^{-3}}\)) that captures how strongly
perception is driven by the available sensory information, and a hazard
rate parameter \(H\) (humans: \(H\) = \(0.45\) ±
\(\ensuremath{4.8\times 10^{-5}}\); mice: \(H\) = \(0.46\) ±
\(\ensuremath{2.97\times 10^{-4}}\)) that controls how heavily
perception is biased by perceptual history. The parameter \(f\) captures
the dominant time scale at which likelihood (amplitude humans:
\(a_{LLR}\) = \(0.5\) ± \(\ensuremath{2.02\times 10^{-4}}\); mice:
\(a_{LLR}\) = \(0.39\) ± \(\ensuremath{1.08\times 10^{-3}}\)) and prior
precision (amplitude humans: \(a_{\psi}\) = \(1.44\) ±
\(\ensuremath{5.27\times 10^{-4}}\); mice: \(a_{\psi}\) = \(1.71\) ±
\(\ensuremath{7.15\times 10^{-3}}\)) fluctuated and was estimated at
\(0.11\) ± \(\ensuremath{1.68\times 10^{-5}}\) 1/\(N_{trials}\) and
\(0.11\) ± \(\ensuremath{1.63\times 10^{-4}}\) 1/\(N_{trials}\) in mice.

As a sanity check for model fit, we tested whether the frequency of
stimulus- and history-congruent trials in the Confidence
database\textsuperscript{20} and IBL database\textsuperscript{21}
correlated with the estimated parameters \(\alpha\) and \(H\),
respectively. As expected, the estimated sensitivity toward stimulus
information \(\alpha\) was positively correlated with the frequency of
stimulus-congruent perceptual choices (humans: \(\beta\) = \(8.4\) ±
\(0.26\), T(\(\ensuremath{4.31\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(32.87\), p =
\(\ensuremath{1.3\times 10^{-211}}\); mice: \(\beta\) = \(1.93\) ±
\(0.12\), T(\(\ensuremath{2.07\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(16.21\), p =
\(\ensuremath{9.37\times 10^{-56}}\)). Likewise, \(H\) was negatively
correlated with the frequency of history-congruent perceptual choices
(humans: \(\beta\) = \(-11.84\) ± \(0.5\),
T(\(\ensuremath{4.29\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(-23.5\), p =
\(\ensuremath{5.16\times 10^{-115}}\); mice: \(\beta\) = \(-6.18\) ±
\(0.66\), T(\(\ensuremath{2.08\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(-9.37\), p =
\(\ensuremath{1.85\times 10^{-20}}\)).

Our behavioral analyses reveal that humans and mice show significant
effects of perceptual history that impaired performance in randomized
psychophysical experiments\textsuperscript{24,28,30,31,43} (Figure 2A
and 3A). We therefore expected that humans and mice underestimated the
true hazard rate \(\hat{H}\) of the experimental environments
(Confidence database\textsuperscript{20}: \(\hat{H}_{Humans}\) = \(0.5\)
± \(\ensuremath{1.58\times 10^{-5}}\)); IBL
database\textsuperscript{21}: \(\hat{H}_{Mice}\) = \(0.49\) ±
\(\ensuremath{6.47\times 10^{-5}}\)). Indeed, when fitting the bimodal
inference model to the trial-wise perceptual choices, we found that the
estimated (i.e., subjective) hazard rate \(H\) was lower than
\(\hat{H}\) for both humans (\(\beta\) = \(-6.87\) ± \(0.94\),
T(\(61.87\)) = \(-7.33\), p = \(\ensuremath{5.76\times 10^{-10}}\)) and
mice (\(\beta\) = \(-2.91\) ± \(0.34\), T(\(112.57\)) = \(-8.51\), p =
\(\ensuremath{8.65\times 10^{-14}}\)).

To further probe the validity of the bimodal inference model, we asked
whether posterior model quantities could explain aspects of the
behavioral data that the model was not fitted to. We predicted that the
posterior decision variable \(L_t\) not only encodes perceptual choices
(i.e., the variable used for model estimation), but also predicts the
speed of response and subjective confidence\textsuperscript{30,44}.
Indeed, the estimated trial-wise posterior decision certainty \(|L_t|\)
correlated negatively with RTs in humans (\(\beta\) =
\(\ensuremath{-4.36\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{4.64\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.98\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-9.41\), p =
\(\ensuremath{5.19\times 10^{-21}}\)) and TDs mice (\(\beta\) =
\(-35.45\) ± \(0.86\), T(\(\ensuremath{1.28\times 10^{6}}\)) =
\(-41.13\), p = \(0\)). Likewise, subjective confidence reports were
positively correlated with the estimated posterior decision certainty in
humans (\(\beta\) = \(\ensuremath{7.63\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{8.32\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.06\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(9.18\), p =
\(\ensuremath{4.48\times 10^{-20}}\)).

The dynamic accumulation of information inherent to our model entails
that biases toward perceptual history are stronger when the posterior
decision certainty at the preceding trial is
high\textsuperscript{30,31,51}. Due to the link between posterior
decision certainty and confidence, confident perceptual choices should
be more likely to induce history-congruent perception at the subsequent
trial\textsuperscript{30,31}. In line with our prediction, logistic
regression indicated that history-congruence was predicted by the
posterior decision certainty \(|L_{t-1}|\) extracted from the model
(humans: \(\beta\) = \(\ensuremath{8.22\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.94\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(4.25\), p =
\(\ensuremath{2.17\times 10^{-5}}\); mice: \(\beta\) =
\(\ensuremath{-3.72\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.83\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(-2.03\), p = \(0.04\)) and
the subjective confidence reported by the participants (humans:
\(\beta\) = \(0.04\) ± \(\ensuremath{1.62\times 10^{-3}}\), z =
\(27.21\), p = \(\ensuremath{4.56\times 10^{-163}}\)) at the preceding
trial.

As a third validation of the bimodal inference model, we used the
posterior model parameters to simulate synthetic perceptual choices and
repeated the behavioral analyses conducted for the empirical data.
Simulations from the bimodal inference model closely replicated our
empirical results: Simulated perceptual decisions resulted from a
competition of perceptual history with incoming sensory signals (Figure
4A). Stimulus- and history-congruence were significantly autocorrelated
(Figure 4B-C), fluctuating in anti-phase as a scale-invariant process
with a 1/f power law (Figure 4D-F). Simulated posterior
certainty\textsuperscript{28,30,44} (i.e., the absolute of the log
posterior ratio \(|L_t|\)) showed a quadratic relationship to the mode
of sensory processing (Figure 4H), mirroring the relation of RTs and
confidence reports to external and internal biases in perception (Figure
2G-H and Figure 3G-H). Crucially, the overlap between empirical and
simulated data broke down when we removed the anti-phase oscillations or
the accumulation of evidence over time from the bimodal inference model
(Supplemental Figures S10-13).

In sum, computational modeling suggested that between-mode fluctuations
are best explained by two interlinked processes (Figure 1E and F): (i),
the dynamic accumulation of information across successive trials
mandated by normative Bayesian models of evidence accumulation and,
(ii), ongoing anti-phase oscillations in the impact of external and
internal information.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

This work investigates the behavioral and computational characteristics
of ongoing fluctuations in perceptual decision-making using two
large-scale datasets in humans\textsuperscript{20} and
mice\textsuperscript{21}. We found that humans and mice cycle through
recurring intervals of reduced sensitivity to external sensory
information, during which they rely more strongly on perceptual history,
i.e., an internal prediction that is provided by the sequence of
preceding choices. Computational modeling indicated that these slow
periodicities are governed by two interlinked factors: (i), the dynamic
integration of sensory inputs over time and, (ii), anti-phase
oscillations in the strength at which perception is driven by internal
versus external sources of information. These cross-species results
suggest that ongoing fluctuations in perceptual decision-making arise
not merely as a noise-related epiphenomenon of limited processing
capacity, but result from a structured and adaptive mechanism that
fluctuates between internally- and externally-oriented modes of sensory
analysis.

\subsection{Bimodal inference represents a pervasive aspect of
perceptual decision-making in humans and
mice}\label{bimodal-inference-represents-a-pervasive-aspect-of-perceptual-decision-making-in-humans-and-mice}}

A growing body of literature has highlighted that perception is
modulated by preceding choices\textsuperscript{22--28,30,32,33}. Our
work provides converging cross-species evidence supporting the notion
that such serial dependencies are a pervasive and general phenomenon of
perceptual decision-making (Figures 2 and 3). While introducing errors
in randomized psychophysical designs\textsuperscript{24,28,30,31,43}
(Figures 2A and 3A), we found that perceptual history facilitates
post-perceptual processes such as speed of response\textsuperscript{42}
(Figure 2G and 3G) and subjective confidence in humans (Figure 2I).

At the level of individual traits, increased biases toward preceding
choices were associated with reduced sensitivity to external information
(Supplemental Figure 1C-D) and lower metacognitive efficiency. When
investigating how serial dependencies evolve over time, we observed
dynamic changes in the strength of perceptual history (Figures 2 and 3B)
that created wavering biases toward internally- and externally-biased
modes of sensory processing. Between-mode fluctuations may thus provide
a new explanation for ongoing changes in perceptual
performance\textsuperscript{6--11}.

In computational terms, serial dependencies may leverage the temporal
autocorrelation of natural environments\textsuperscript{31,46} to
increase the efficiency of decision-making\textsuperscript{35,43}. Such
temporal smoothing\textsuperscript{46} of sensory inputs may be achieved
by updating dynamic predictions about the world based on the sequence of
noisy perceptual experiences\textsuperscript{22,31}, using algorithms
based on sequential Bayes\textsuperscript{25,42,51} such as
Kalman\textsuperscript{35} or Hierarchical Gaussian
filtering\textsuperscript{54}. At the level of neural mechanisms, the
integration of internal with external information may be realized by
combining feedback from higher levels in the cortical hierarchy with
incoming sensory signals that are fed forward from lower
levels\textsuperscript{56}.

Yet relying too strongly on serial dependencies may come at a cost: When
accumulating over time, internal predictions may eventually override
external information, leading to circular and false inferences about the
state of the environment\textsuperscript{57}. Akin to the
wake-sleep-algorithm in machine learning\textsuperscript{58}, bimodal
inference may help to determine whether errors result from external
input or from internally-stored predictions: During internal mode,
sensory processing is more strongly constrained by predictive processes
that auto-encode the agent's environment. Conversely, during external
mode, the network is driven predominantly by sensory
inputs\textsuperscript{18}. Between-mode fluctuations may thus generate
an unambiguous error signal that aligns internal predictions with the
current state of the environment in iterative
test-update-cycles\textsuperscript{58}. On a broader scale, between-mode
fluctuations may thus regulate the balance between feedforward versus
feedback contributions to perception and thereby play a adaptive role in
metacognition and reality monitoring\textsuperscript{59}.

We hypothesized that observers have certain hyperpriors that are apt for
accommodating fluctuations in the predictability of their environment,
i.e., people believe that their world is inherently volatile. To be
Bayes optimal, it is therefore necessary to periodically re-evaluate
posterior beliefs about the parameters that define an internal
generative model of the external sensory environment. One way to do this
is to periodically suspend the precision of prior beliefs and increase
the precision afforded to sensory evidence, thus updating Bayesian
beliefs about model parameters.

The empirical evidence above suggests that the timescale of this
periodic scheduling of evidence accumulation may be scale-invariant.
This means that there may exist a timescale of periodic fluctuations in
precision over every window or length of perceptual decision-making.
Bimodal inference predicts perceptual decisions under a generative model
(based upon a hazard function to model serial dependencies between
subsequent trials) with periodic fluctuations in the precision of
sensory evidence relative to prior beliefs at a particular timescale.
Remarkably, a systematic model comparison based on AIC indicated that a
model with fluctuating precisions has much greater evidence, relative to
a model in the absence of fluctuating precisions. This ad-hoc addition
of oscillations to a normative Bayesian model of evidence
accumulation\textsuperscript{51} allowed us to quantify the dominant
timescale of periodic fluctuations mode at approximately 0.11
1/\(N_{trials}\) in humans and mice that is appropriate for these kinds
of paradigms.

Could bimodal inference emerge spontaneously in normative models of
perceptual decision-making? In predictive processing, the relative
precision of prior and likelihood determines their integration into the
posterior that determines the content of perception. At the level of
individual trials, the perceptual impact of internal predictions
generated from perceptual history (prior precision) and external sensory
information (likelihood precision) are thus necessarily anti-correlated.
The same holds for mechanistic models of drift diffusion, which
understand choice history biases as driven by changes in the starting
point\textsuperscript{51} or the drift rate of evidence
accumulation\textsuperscript{32}. Under the former formulation,
perceptual history is bound to have a stronger influence on perception
when less weight is given to incoming sensory evidence, assuming that
the last choice is represented as a starting point bias. The effects of
choice history in normative Bayesian and mechanistic drift diffusion
models can be mapped onto one another via the Bayesian formulation of
drift diffusion\textsuperscript{60}, where the inverse of likelihood
precision determines the amount of noise in the accumulation of new
evidence, and prior precision determines the absolute shift in its
starting point\textsuperscript{60}.

While it is thus clear that the impact of perceptual history and sensory
evidence are anti-correlated \emph{at each individual trial}, we here
introduce anti-phase oscillations as an ad-hoc modification to model
slow fluctuations in prior and likelihood precision that evolve
\emph{over many consecutive trials} and are not mandated by normative
Bayesian or mechanistic drift diffusion models. The bimodal inference
model provides a reasonable explanation of the linked autocorrelations
in stimulus- and history-congruence, as evidenced by formal model
comparison, successful prediction of RTs and confidence as
out-of-training variables, and a qualitative reproduction of our
empirical data from posterior model parameter as evidence against over-
or under-fitting.

Of note, similar non-stationarities have been observed in descriptive
models that assume continuous\textsuperscript{61} or
discrete\textsuperscript{12} changes in the latent states that modulate
perceptual decision-making at slow timescales. A recent computational
study\textsuperscript{62} has used a Hidden Markov model to investigate
perceptual decision-making in the IBL database\textsuperscript{21}. In
analogy to our findings, the authors observed that mice switch between
temporally extended \emph{strategies} that last for more than 100
trials: During \emph{engaged} states, perception was highly sensitive to
external sensory information. During \emph{disengaged} states, in turn,
choice behavior was prone to errors due to enhanced biases toward one of
the two perceptual outcomes\textsuperscript{62}. Despite the conceptual
differences to our approach (discrete states in a Hidden Markov model
that correspond to switches between distinct decision-making
strategies\textsuperscript{62} vs.~gradual changes in mode that emerge
from sequential Bayesian inference and ongoing oscillations in the
impact of external relative to internal information), it is tempting to
speculate that engaged/disengaged states and between-mode fluctuations
might tap into the same underlying phenomenon.

\subsection{Task engagement and residual motor activation as alternative
explanations for bimodal
inference}\label{task-engagement-and-residual-motor-activation-as-alternative-explanations-for-bimodal-inference}}

As a functional explanation for bimodal inference, we propose that
perception temporarily disengages from internal predictions to form
stable inferences about the statistical properties of the sensory
environment. Between-mode fluctuations may thus elude circular
inferences that occur when both the causes and the encoding of sensory
stimuli are volatile\textsuperscript{19,57}. By the same token, we
suggest that fluctuations in mode occur at the level of perceptual
processing\textsuperscript{26,30,46,47}, and are not a passive
phenomenon that is primarily driven by factors situated up- or
downstream of sensory analysis.

How does attention relate to phenomenon of between-mode fluctuations?
According to predictive processing, attention corresponds to the
precision afforded to the probability distributions that underlie
perceptual inference\textsuperscript{53}. From this perspective,
fluctuations between external and internal mode can be understood as
ongoing shifts in the attention afforded to either external sensory
information (regulated via likelihood precision) or internal predictions
(regulated via prior precision). When the precision of either likelihood
or prior increases, posterior precision increases, which leads to faster
RTs and higher confidence. Therefore, when defined from the perspective
of predictive processing as the precision afforded to likelihood and
prior\textsuperscript{53}, fluctuations in attention may provide a
plausible explanation for the quadratic relationship of mode to RTs and
confidence (Figure 2H and J; Figure 3I, Figure 4I).

Outside of the predictive processing field, attention is often
understood in the context of task engagement\textsuperscript{63}, which
varies according to the availability of cognitive resources that are
modulated by factors such as tonic arousal, familiarity with the task,
or fatigue\textsuperscript{63}. Our results suggest that internal mode
processing cannot be completely reduced to intervals of low task
engagement: In addition to shorter RTs and elevated confidence, choices
during internal mode were not random or globally biased, but driven by
perceptual history (Supplemental Section). Moreover, our computational
model identified the dominant timescale of between-mode fluctuations at
0.11 1/\(N_{trials}\), which may be compatible with fluctuations in
arousal\textsuperscript{64}, but is faster than to be expected for the
development of task familiarity or fatigue.

However, in interpreting the impact of between-mode fluctuations on
perceptual accuracy, speed of response and confidence, it is important
to consider that global modulators such as tonic arousal are known to
have non-linear effects on task performance\textsuperscript{65}: In
perceptual tasks, performance seems so be highest during mid-level
arousal, whereas low- and high-level arousal lead to reduced accuracy
and slower responses\textsuperscript{65}. This contrasts with the
effects of bimodal inference, where accuracy increases linearly as one
moves from internal to external mode, and responses become faster at
both ends of the mode spectrum.

Of note, high phasic arousal has been shown to suppress biases in
decision-making in humans and mice across
domains\textsuperscript{66--68}, including biases toward perceptual
history\textsuperscript{28} that we implicate in internal mode
processing. While the increase in response speed and history congruence
over time (Supplemental Section 9.4) may argue against insufficient
training as an alternative explanation for internal mode processing, it
may also be indicative of waning arousal. The multiple mechanistic
mappings to RTs and confidence warrant more direct measures of arousal
(such as pupil size\textsuperscript{28,65,66,68--70}, motor
behavior\textsuperscript{69,70}, or neural data\textsuperscript{71}) to
better delineate bimodal inference from fluctuations in global
modulators of task performance.

Residual activation of the motor system may provide another contribution
to serial biases in perceptual choices\textsuperscript{72}. Such
motor-driven priming may lead to errors in randomized psychophysical
designs, resembling the phenomenon that we identify as internally-biased
processing\textsuperscript{73}. Moreover, residual activation of the
motor system may lead to faster responses, and thus constitutes an
alternative explanation for the quadratic relationship of mode with
RTs\textsuperscript{72}. The observation of elevated confidence for
stronger biases toward internal mode speaks against the proposition that
residual activation of the motor system is the primary driver of serial
choice biases, since strong motor-driven priming should lead to frequent
lapses that are typically associated reduced
confidence\textsuperscript{74}. Likewise, perceptual history effects
have repeatedly been replicated in experiments with counter-balanced
stimulus-response mappings\textsuperscript{30: Feigin2021}.

No-response paradigms, in which perceptual decision are inferred from
eye-movements alone, could help to better differentiate perceptual from
motor-related effects. Likewise, video-tracking of response behavior and
neural recording from motor- and premotor, which has recently been
released for the IBL database{[}IBL2023{]}, may provide further insight
into the relation of motor behavior to the perceptual phenomenon of
between-mode fluctuations.

\hypertarget{limitations-and-open-questions}{%
\subsection{Limitations and open
questions}\label{limitations-and-open-questions}}

Our results suggest bimodal inference as a pervasive aspect of
perceptual decision-making in humans and mice. However, a number of
limitations and open questions have to be considered:

First, this work sought to understand whether fluctuations between
internal and external mode, which we initially observed in an experiment
on bistable perception in humans\textsuperscript{19}, represent a
general phenomenon that occurs across a diverse set of perceptual
decision-making tasks. Our analysis of the Confidence
database\textsuperscript{20} therefore collapsed across all available
experiments on binary perceptual decision-making. Individual experiments
differed with respect to the stimuli, the manipulation of difficulty,
the timing of trials, and the way responses were collected, but were
highly comparable with respect to the central variables of stimulus- and
history-congruence (Supplemental Figure S1A-B).

The variability across experiments, which we considered as random
effects in all statistical analyses, enabled us to assess whether
bimodal inference represents a general phenomenon in perceptual
decision-making, but limited the precision at which we were able to
investigate the relation of mode to behavioral variables such as timing,
task difficulty, RT or confidence. This issue is partially resolved by
our analyses of the IBL database, which replicated our findings in an
experiment that was highly standardized with respect to timing, task
difficulty, and behavioral read-out\textsuperscript{21}. It will be an
important task for future research to validate our results on bimodal
inference in a standardized dataset of comparable volume in humans,
which is, to our knowledge, not yet available.

Second, our results point to an attraction of perception toward
preceding choices. Previous work has shown that perceptual
decision-making is concurrently affected by both attractive and
repulsive serial biases that operate on distinct time-scales and serve
complementary functions for sensory
processing\textsuperscript{27,75,76}: Short-term attraction may serve
the decoding of noisy sensory inputs and increase the stability of
perception, whereas long-term repulsion may enable efficient encoding
and sensitivity to change\textsuperscript{27}. In the data analyzed
here, history biases tended to be repetitive (Figure 2A, Figure 3A,
Supplemental Figure S6 and S7), and only 2 of the 66 experiments of the
Confidence database\textsuperscript{20} showed significant alternating
biases (Supplemental Figure S1). However, as we show in Supplemental
Figure S14, fluctuations in both alternating and repeating history
biases generate overlapping autocorrelation curves. Our analysis of
between-mode fluctuations is therefore not tied exclusively to repeating
biases, but accommodates alternating biases as well, such that both may
lead to internally-biased processing and reduced sensitivity to external
sensory information. Future work could apply our approach to paradigms
that boost alternating as opposed to repeating biases, as this would
help to better understand how repetition and alternation are linked in
terms of their computational function and neural
implementation\textsuperscript{27}.

A third open question concerns the computational underpinnings of
bimodal inference. The addition of slow anti-phase oscillations to the
integration of prior and likelihood represents an ad-hoc modification of
a normative Bayesian model of evidence accumulation\textsuperscript{51}.
While the bimodal inference model is supported by formal model
comparison, the successful prediction of out-of-training variables and
the qualitative reproduction of our empirical data in simulations from
posterior model parameters, it is an important task for future research
to test (i), whether between-mode fluctuations can emerge spontaneously
in hierarchical models of Bayesian inference, (ii), whether modes are
continuous\textsuperscript{19} or discrete\textsuperscript{62}, and
(iii), whether bimodal inference can be causally manipulated by
experimental variables. We speculate that between-mode fluctuations may
separate the perceptual contribution of internal predictions and
external sensory data in time, creating unambiguous learning signals
that benefit inference about the precision of prior and likelihood,
respectively. This proposition should be tested empirically by relating
the phenomenon of bimodal inference to performance in, e.g., reversal
learning, probabilistic reasoning, or metacognition.

A final important avenue for further research on bimodal inference is to
elucidate its neurobiological underpinnings. Since between-mode
fluctuations were found in humans and mice, future studies can apply
non-invasive and invasive neuro-imaging and electrophysiology to better
understand the neural mechanisms that generate ongoing changes in mode
in terms of their neuro-anatomy, -chemistry and -circuitry.

Establishing the neural correlates of externally- an internally-biased
modes will enable exiting opportunities to investigate their role for
adaptive perception and decision-making: Causal interventions via
pharmacological challenges, optogenetic manipulations or (non-)invasive
brain stimulation will help to understand whether between-mode
fluctuations are implicated in resolving credit-assignment
problems\textsuperscript{18,77} or in calibrating metacognition and
reality monitoring\textsuperscript{59}. Answers to these questions may
provide new insights into the pathophysiology of hallucinations and
delusions, which have been characterized by an imbalance in the impact
of external versus internal information\textsuperscript{56,78,79} and
are typically associated with metacognitive failures and a departure
from consensual reality\textsuperscript{79}.

which participants made binary perceptual decisions between two
alternatives. We excluded two experiments in which the average
perceptual accuracy fell below 50\%. After excluding these experiments,
our sample consisted of \(21.05\) million trials obtained from 4317
human participants and 66 individual experiments (Supplemental Table 1).

\hypertarget{method-details}{%
\subsection{Method details}\label{method-details}}

\hypertarget{variables-of-interest}{%
\subsubsection{Variables of interest}\label{variables-of-interest}}

\textbf{Primary variables of interest:} We extracted trial-wise data on
the presented stimulus and the associated perceptual decision.
Stimulus-congruent choices were defined by perceptual decisions that
matched the presented stimuli. History-congruent choices were defined by
perceptual choices that matched the perceptual choice at the immediately
preceding trial. The dynamic probabilities of stimulus- and
history-congruence were computed in sliding windows of ±5 trials.

The \emph{mode} of sensory processing was derived by subtracting the
dynamic probability of history-congruence from the dynamic probability
of stimulus-congruence, such that positive values indicate
externally-oriented processing, whereas negative values indicate
internally-oriented processing. When visualizing the relation of the
mode of sensory processing to confidence, RTs or trial duration (see
below), we binned the mode variable in 10\% intervals. We excluded bins
that contained less than 0.5\% of the total number of available
data-points.

\textbf{Secondary variables of interest}: From the Confidence
Database\textsuperscript{20}, we furthermore extracted trial-wise
confidence reports and RTs. Out of the 58 experiments that provide
information on RTs, 46 cued the response by the onset of a response
screen or an additional response cue, whereas 14 allowed participants to
response at any time after stimulus onset. If RTs were available for
both the perceptual decision and the confidence report, we only
extracted the RT associated with the perceptual decision. To enable
comparability between studies, we normalized RTs and confidence reports
within individual studies using the \emph{scale} R function. If not
available for a particular study, RTs were treated as missing variables.
From the IBL database\textsuperscript{21}, we extracted trial durations
(TDs) as defined by interval between stimulus onset and feedback, which
represents a coarse measure of RT\textsuperscript{21}.

\textbf{Exclusion criteria for individual data-points:} For
non-normalized data (TDs from the IBL database\textsuperscript{21};
d-prime, meta-dprime and M-ratio from the Confidence
database\textsuperscript{20} and simulated confidence reports), we
excluded data-points that differed from the median by more than 3 x MAD
(median absolute distance\textsuperscript{49}). For normalized data (RTs
and confidence reports from the Confidence
database\textsuperscript{20}), we excluded data-points that differed
from the mean by more than 3 x SD (standard deviation).

\hypertarget{control-variables}{%
\subsubsection{Control variables}\label{control-variables}}

Next to the sequence of presented stimuli, we assessed the
autocorrelation of task difficulty as an alternative explanation for any
autocorrelation in stimulus- and history-congruence. In the Confidence
Database\textsuperscript{20}, 21 of the 66 included experiments used
fixed difficulty levels, whereas 45 manipulated difficulty levels within
participants. Difficulty was manipulated via noise masks, contrast,
luminance, presentation time, or stimulus probability for gabors, dot
coherence for random dot kinematograms, difference in elements and set
size for comparisons of numerosity, difference in clicks for auditory
discrimination, temporal distance for meta-contrast masking, and amount
of self-motion for proprioception. We treated task difficulty as a
missing variable for the experiments that fixed it at the
participant-level, as this precluded the computation of autocorrelation
curves. In analogy to RTs and confidence, difficulty levels were
normalized within individual studies. For the IBL
Database\textsuperscript{21}, task difficulty was defined by the
contrast of the presented grating.

\hypertarget{autocorrelations}{%
\subsubsection{Autocorrelations}\label{autocorrelations}}

For each participant, trial-wise autocorrelation coefficients were
estimated using the R-function \emph{acf} with a maximum lag defined by
the number of trials available per subject. Autocorrelation coefficients
are displayed against the lag (in numbers of trials, ranging from 1 to
20) relative to the index trial (t = 0; Figure 2B-C, 3B-C and 4B-C). To
account for spurious autocorrelations that occur due to imbalances in
the analyzed variables, we estimated autocorrelations for randomly
permuted data (100 iterations). For group-level autocorrelations, we
computed the differences between the true autocorrelation coefficients
and the mean autocorrelation observed for randomly permuted data and
averaged across participants.

At a given trial, group-level autocorrelation coefficients were
considered significant when linear mixed effects modeling indicated that
the difference between real and permuted autocorrelation coefficients
was above zero at an alpha level of 0.05\%. To test whether the
autocorrelation of stimulus- and history-congruence remained significant
when controlling for task difficulty and the sequence of presented
stimuli, we added the respective autocorrelation as an additional factor
to the linear mixed effects model that computed the group-level
statistics (see also \emph{Mixed effects modeling}).

To assess autocorrelations at the level of individual participants, we
counted the number of subsequent trials (starting at the first trial
after the index trial) for which less than 50\% of the permuted
autocorrelation coefficients exceeded the true autocorrelation
coefficient. For example, a count of zero indicates that the true
autocorrelation coefficients exceeded \emph{less than 50\%} of the
autocorrelation coefficients computed for randomly permuted data at the
first trial following the index trial. A count of five indicates that,
for the first five trials following the index trial, the true
autocorrelation coefficients exceeded \emph{more than 50\%} of the
respective autocorrelation coefficients for the randomly permuted data;
at the 6th trial following the index trial, however, \emph{less than
50\%} of the autocorrelation coefficients exceeded the respective
permuted autocorrelation coefficients.

\hypertarget{spectral-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Spectral analysis}\label{spectral-analysis}}

We used the R function \emph{spectrum} to compute the spectral densities
for the dynamic probabilities of stimulus- and history-congruence as
well as the phase (i.e., frequency-specific shift between the two
time-series ranging from 0 to \(2*\pi\)) and squared coherence
(frequency-specific variable that denotes the degree to which the shift
between the two time-series in constant, ranging from 0 to 100\%).
Periodograms were smoothed using modified Daniell smoothers at a width
of 50.

Since the dynamic probabilities of history- and stimulus-congruence were
computed using a sliding windows of ±5 trials (i.e., intervals
containing a total of 11 trials), we report the spectral density,
coherence and phase for frequencies below 1/11 1/\(N_{trials}\).
Spectral densities have one value per subject and frequency (data shown
in Figures 2D and 3D). To assess the relation between stimulus- and
history-congruence in this frequency range, we report average phase and
average squared coherence for all frequencies below 1/11
1/\(N_{trials}\) (i.e., one value per subject; data shown in Figure 2E-F
and 3E-F).

Since the data extracted from the Confidence
Database\textsuperscript{20} consist of a large set of individual
studies that differ with respect to inter-trial intervals, we defined
the variable \emph{frequency} in the dimension of cycles per trial
1/\(N_{trials}\) rather than cycles per second (Hz). For consistency, we
chose 1/\(N_{trials}\) as the unit of frequency for the IBL
database\textsuperscript{21} as well.

\hypertarget{quantification-and-statistical-procedures}{%
\subsection{Quantification and statistical
procedures}\label{quantification-and-statistical-procedures}}

All aggregate data are reported and displayed with errorbars as mean ±
standard error of the mean.

\hypertarget{mixed-effects-modeling}{%
\subsubsection{Mixed effects modeling}\label{mixed-effects-modeling}}

Unless indicated otherwise, we performed group-level inference using the
R-packages \emph{lmer} and \emph{afex} for linear mixed effects modeling
and \emph{glmer} with a binomial link-function for logistic regression.
We compared models based on AIC. To account for variability between the
studies available from the Confidence Database\textsuperscript{20},
mixed modeling was conducted using random intercepts defined for each
study. To account for variability across experimental session within the
IBL database\textsuperscript{21}, mixed modeling was conducted using
random intercepts defined for each individual session. When multiple
within-participant datapoints were analyzed, we estimated random
intercepts for each participant that were \emph{nested} within the
respective study of the Confidence database\textsuperscript{20}. By
analogy, for the IBL database\textsuperscript{21}, we estimated random
intercepts for each session that were nested within the respective
mouse. We report \(\beta\) values referring to the estimates provided by
mixed effects modeling, followed by the respective T statistic (linear
models) or z statistic (logistic models).

The effects of stimulus- and history-congruence on RTs and confidence
reports (Figure 2, 3 and 4, subpanels G-I) were assessed in linear mixed
effects models that tested for main effects of both stimulus- and
history-congruence as well as the between-factor interaction. Thus, the
significance of any effect of history-congruence on RTs and confidence
reports was assessed while controlling for the respective effect of
stimulus-congruence (and vice versa).

\hypertarget{psychometric-function}{%
\subsubsection{Psychometric function}\label{psychometric-function}}

We obtained psychometric curves by fitting the following error function
to the behavioral data:

\begin{equation}
y_p = \gamma + (1 - \gamma - \delta) *  (erf(\frac{s_w + \mu}{t}) + 1) / 2
\end{equation}

We used the Broyden--Fletcher--Goldfarb--Shanno algorithm in maximum
likelihood estimation\textsuperscript{80} to predict individual choices
\(y\) (outcome A: \(y = 0\); outcome B: \(y = 1\)) from the choice
probability \(y_p\). In humans, we computed \(s_w\) by multiplying the
inputs \(s\) (stimulus A: 0; outcome B: 1) with the task difficulty
\(D_b\) (binarized across 7 levels):

\begin{equation}
s_w = (s - 0.5) * D_b
\end{equation}

In mice, \(s_w\) was defined by the respective stimulus contrast in the
two hemifields:

\begin{equation}
s_w = Contrast_{Right} - Contrast_{Left}
\end{equation}

Parameters of the psychometric error function were fitted using the
R-package \emph{optimx}\textsuperscript{80}. The psychometric error
function was defined via the parameters \(\gamma\) (lower lapse; lower
bound = 0, upper bound = 0.5), \(\delta\) (upper lapse; lower bound = 0,
upper bound = 0.5), \(\mu\) (bias; lower bound humans = -5; upper bound
humans = 5, lower bound mice = -0.5, upper bound mice = 0.5) and
threshold \(t\) (lower bound humans = 0.5, upper bound humans = 25;
lower bound mice = 0.01, upper bound mice = 1.5).

\hypertarget{computational-modeling}{%
\subsubsection{Computational modeling}\label{computational-modeling}}

\textbf{Model definition}: Our modeling analysis is an extension of a
model proposed by Glaze et al.\textsuperscript{51}, who defined a
normative account of evidence accumulation for decision-making. In this
model, trial-wise choices are explained by applying Bayes theorem to
infer moment-by-moment changes in the state of environment from
trial-wise noisy observations across trials.

Following Glaze et al.\textsuperscript{51}, we applied Bayes rule to
compute the posterior evidence for the two alternative choices (i.e.,
the log posterior ratio \(L\)) from the sensory evidence available at
time-point \(t\) (i.e., the log likelihood ratio \(LLR\)) with the prior
probability \(\psi\), weighted by the respective precision terms
\(\omega_{LLR}\) and \(\omega_{\psi}\):

\begin{equation}
L_t = LLR_t * \omega_{LLR} + \psi_t(L_{t-1}, H) * \omega_{\psi}
\end{equation}

In the trial-wise design studied here, a transition between the two
states of the environment (i.e., the sources generating the noisy
observations available to the participant) can occur at any time.
Despite the random nature of the psychophysical paradigms studied
here\textsuperscript{20,21}, humans and mice showed significant biases
toward preceding choices (Figure 2A and 3A). We thus assumed that the
prior probability of the two possible outcomes depends on the posterior
choice probability at the preceding trial and the hazard rate \(H\)
assumed by the participant. Following Glaze et al.\textsuperscript{51},
the prior \(\psi\) is thus computed as follows:

\begin{equation}
\psi_t(L_{t-1}, H)  = L_{t-1} + log(\frac{1-H}{H} + exp(-L_{t-1})) - log(\frac{1-H}{H} + exp(L_{t-1}))
\end{equation}

In this model, humans, mice and simulated agents make perceptual choices
based on noisy observations \(u\). The are computed by applying a
sensitivity parameter \(\alpha\) to the content of external sensory
information \(s\). For humans, we defined the input \(s\) by the two
alternative states of the environment (stimulus A: \(s = 0\); stimulus
B: \(s = 1\)), which generated the observations \(u\) through a sigmoid
function that applied a sensitivity parameter \(\alpha\):

\begin{equation}
u_t = \frac{1}{1+exp(-\alpha*(s_t-0.5))}
\end{equation}

In mice, the inputs \(s\) were defined by the respective stimulus
contrast in the two hemifields:

\begin{equation}
s_t = Contrast_{Right} - Contrast_{Left}
\end{equation}

As in humans, we derived the input \(u\) by applying a sigmoid function
with a sensitivity parameter \(\alpha\) to input \(s\):

\begin{equation}
u_t = \frac{1}{1 + exp(-\alpha * s_t)}
\end{equation}

For humans, mice and in simulations, the log likelihood ratio \(LLR\)
was computed from \(u\) as follows:

\begin{equation}
LLR_t = log(\frac{u_t}{1-u_t})
\end{equation}

To allow for long-range autocorrelation in stimulus- and
history-congruence (Figure 2B and 3B), our modeling approach differed
from Glaze et al.\textsuperscript{51} in that it allowed for systematic
fluctuation in the impact of sensory information (i.e., \(LLR\)) and the
prior probability of choices \(\psi\) on the posterior probability
\(L\). This was achieved by multiplying the log likelihood ratio and the
log prior ratio with coherent anti-phase fluctuations according to
\(\omega_{LLR} = a_{LLR} * sin(f * t + phase) + 1\) and
\(\omega_{\psi} = a_{\psi} * sin(f * t + phase + \pi) + 1\).

\textbf{Model fitting}: In model fitting, we predicted the trial-wise
choices \(y_t\) (option A: 0; option B: 1) from inputs \(s\). To this
end, we minimized the log loss between \(y_t\) and the choice
probability \(y_{p t}\) in the unit interval. \(y_{p t}\) was derived
from \(L_t\) using a sigmoid function defined by the inverse decision
temperature \(\zeta\):

\begin{equation}
y_{p t} = \frac{1}{1 + exp(-\zeta * L_t)}
\end{equation}

This allowed us to infer the free parameters \(H\) (lower bound = 0,

with the Broyden--Fletcher--Goldfarb--Shanno algorithm as implemented in
the R-function \emph{optimx}\textsuperscript{80} (see Supplemental Table
T2 for a description of our model parameters).

We validated the bimodal inference model in three steps: a formal model
comparison to reduced models based on AIC (Figure 1F-G; Supplemental
Figure S9), the prediction of within-training (stimulus- and
history-congruence) as well as out-of-training variables (RT and
confidence), and a qualitative reproduction of the empirical data from
model simulations based on estimated parameters (Figure 4).

\textbf{Model comparison.} We assessed the following model space based
on AIC:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The full \emph{bimodal inference model} (M1; Figure 1F) incorporates
  the influence of sensory information according to the parameter
  \(\alpha\) (likelihood); the integration of evidence across trials
  according to the parameter \(H\) (prior); anti-phase oscillations in
  between likelihood and prior precision according to \(\omega_{LLR}\)
  and \(\omega_{\psi}\) with parameters \(a_{LLR}\) (amplitude
  likelihood fluctuation), \(a_{\psi}\) (amplitude prior fluctuation),
  \(f\) (frequency) and \(p\) (phase).
\item
  The \emph{likelihood-oscillation-only model} (M2; Figure 1G)
  incorporates the influence of sensory information according to
  parameter \(\alpha\) (likelihood); the integration of evidence across
  trials according to parameter \(H\) (prior); oscillations in
  likelihood precision according to \(\omega_{LLR}\) with parameters
  \(a_{LLR}\) (amplitude likelihood fluctuation), \(f\) (frequency) and
  \(p\) (phase).
\item
  The \emph{prior-oscillation-only model} (M3; Figure 1G) incorporates
  the influence of sensory information according to parameter \(\alpha\)
  (likelihood); the integration of evidence across trials according to
  parameter \(H\) (prior); oscillations in the prior precision according
  to \(\omega_{\psi}\) with parameters \(a_{\psi}\) (amplitude prior
  fluctuation), \(f\) (frequency) and \(p\) (phase). Please note that
  all models M1-3 lead to shifts in the relative precision of likelihood
  and prior.
\item
  The \emph{normative-evidence-accumulation} (M4; Figure 1G)
  incorporates the influence of sensory information according to
  parameter \(\alpha\) (likelihood); the integration of evidence across
  trials according to parameter \(H\) (prior), There are no additional
  oscillations. Model M4 thus corresponds to the model proposed by Glaze
  et al.~and captures normative evidence accumulation in unpredictable
  environments using a Bayesian update scheme\textsuperscript{51}. The
  comparison against M4 tests the null hypothesis that fluctuations in
  mode emerge from a normative Bayesian model without the ad-hoc
  addition of oscillations as in models M1-3.
\item
  The \emph{no-evidence-accumulation} (M5; Figure 1G) incorporates the
  influence of sensory information according to parameter \(\alpha\)
  (likelihood). The model lacks integration of evidence across trials
  (flat prior) and oscillations. The comparison against M5 tests the
  null hypothesis that observers do not use prior information derived
  from serial dependency in perception.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Prediction of within-training and out-of-training variables.} To
validate our model, we correlated individual posterior parameter
estimates with the respective conventional variables. As a sanity check,
we tested (i), whether the estimated hazard rate \(H\) correlated
negatively with the frequency of history-congruent choices and, (ii),
whether the estimated sensitivity to sensory information \(\alpha\)
correlated positively with the frequency of stimulus-congruent choices.
In addition, we tested whether the posterior decision certainty (i.e..
the absolute of the log posterior ratio) correlated negatively with RTs
and positively with confidence. This allowed us to assess whether our
model could explain aspects of the data it was not fitted to (i.e., RTs
and confidence).

\textbf{Simulations.} Finally, we used simulations (Figure 4,
Supplemental Figures S10-13) to show that all model components,
including the anti-phase oscillations governed by \(a_{\psi}\),
\(a_{LLR}\), \(f\) and \(p\), were necessary for our model to reproduce
the characteristics of the empirical data. This enabled us to assess
over- or under-fitting in the bimodal inference model and all reduced
models M2-M5. We used the posterior model parameters observed for humans
(\(H\), \(\alpha\), \(a_{\psi}\), \(a_{LLR}\), \(f\), \(p\) and
\(\zeta\)) to define individual parameters for simulation in 4317
simulated participants (i.e., equivalent to the number of human
participants). For each participant, the number of simulated trials was
drawn at random between 300 to 700. Inputs \(s\) were drawn at random
for each trial, such that the sequence of inputs to the simulation did
not contain any systematic seriality. Noisy observations \(u\) were
generated by applying the posterior parameter \(\alpha\) to inputs
\(s\), thus generating stimulus-congruent choices in \(71.36\) ±
\(\ensuremath{2.6\times 10^{-3}}\)\% of trials. Choices were simulated
based on the trial-wise choice probabilities \(y_{p}\) obtained from our
model. Simulated data were analyzed in analogy to the human and mouse
data. As a substitute of subjective confidence, we computed the absolute
of the trial-wise log posterior ratio \(|L|\) (i.e., the posterior
decision certainty).

\textbf{Figure 1. Concept.}

A. In binary perceptual decision-making, a participant is presented with
stimuli from two categories (A vs.~B; dotted line) and reports
consecutive perceptual choices via button presses (sold line). All
panels below refer to these stimulated example data.

B. When the response matches the external stimulus information (i.e.,
overlap between dotted and solid line in panel A), perceptual choices
are \emph{stimulus-congruent} (red line). When the response matches the
response at the preceding trial, perceptual choices are
\emph{history-congruent} (blue line).

C. The dynamic probabilities of stimulus- and history-congruence (i.e.,
computed in sliding windows of ±5 trials) fluctuate over time.

D. The \emph{mode} of perceptual processing is derived by computing the
difference between the dynamic probabilities of stimulus- and
history-congruence. Values above 0\% indicate a bias toward external
information, whereas values below 0\% indicate a bias toward internal
information.

E. In computational modeling, internal mode is caused by an enhanced
impact of perceptual history. This causes the posterior (black line) to
be close to the prior (blue line). Conversely, during external mode, the
posterior is close to the sensory information (log likelihood ratio, red
line).

F. The bimodal inference model (M1) explains fluctuations between
externally- and externally-biased modes (left panel) by two interacting
factors: a normative accumulation of evidence according to parameters
\(H\) (middle panel), and anti-phase oscillations in the precision terms
\(\omega_{LLR}\) and \(\omega_{\psi}\) (right panel).

G. The control models M2-M5 were constructed by successively removing
the anti-phase oscillations and the integration of information from the
bimodal inference model. Please note that the
normative-evidence-accumulation-model (M4) corresponds to the model
proposed by Glaze et al.\textsuperscript{51}. In the
no-evidence-accumulation model (M5), perceptual decisions depend only on
likelihood information (flat priors).

\textbf{Figure 2. Internal and external modes in human perceptual
decision-making.}

A. In humans, perception was stimulus-congruent in 73.46\% ± 0.15\% (in
red) and history-congruent in 52.7\% ± 0.12\% of trials (in blue; upper
panel). History-congruent perceptual choices were more frequent when
perception was stimulus-incongruent (i.e., on \emph{error} trials; lower
panel), indicating that history effects impair performance in randomized
psychophysical designs.

B. Relative to randomly permuted data, we found highly significant
autocorrelations of stimulus-congruence and history-congruence (dots
indicate intercepts \(\neq\) 0 in trial-wise linear mixed effects
modeling at p \textless{} 0.05). Across trials, the autocorrelation
coefficients were best fit by an exponential function (adjusted \(R^2\)
for stimulus-congruence: 0.53; history-congruence: 0.72) as compared to
a linear function (adjusted \(R^2\) for stimulus-congruence: 0.53;
history-congruence: 0.51), decaying at a rate of \(\gamma\) =
\(\ensuremath{-1.92\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{4.5\times 10^{-4}}\)
(T(\(\ensuremath{6.88\times 10^{4}}\)) = \(-4.27\), p =
\(\ensuremath{1.98\times 10^{-5}}\)) for stimulus-congruence and at a
rate of \(\gamma\) = \(\ensuremath{-6.11\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{5.69\times 10^{-4}}\)
(T(\(\ensuremath{6.75\times 10^{4}}\)) = \(-10.74\), p =
\(\ensuremath{7.18\times 10^{-27}}\)) for history-congruence.

C. Here, we depict the number of consecutive trials at which
autocorrelation coefficients exceeded the respective autocorrelation of
randomly permuted data within individual participants. For
stimulus-congruence (upper panel), the lag of positive autocorrelation
amounted to \(3.24\) ± \(\ensuremath{2.39\times 10^{-3}}\) on average,
showing a peak at trial t+1 after the index trial. For
history-congruence (lower panel), the lag of positive autocorrelation
amounted to \(4.87\) ± \(\ensuremath{3.36\times 10^{-3}}\) on average,
peaking at trial t+2 after the index trial.

D. The smoothed probabilities of stimulus- and history-congruence
(sliding windows of ±5 trials) fluctuated as a scale-invariant process
with a 1/f power law, i.e., at power densities that were inversely
proportional to the frequency.

E. The distribution of phase shift between fluctuations in stimulus- and
history-congruence peaked at half a cycle (\(\pi\) denoted by dotted
line).

F. The average squared coherence between fluctuations in stimulus- and
history-congruence (black dotted line) amounted to \(6.49\) ±
\(\ensuremath{2.07\times 10^{-3}}\)\%

G. We observed faster RTs for both stimulus-congruence (as opposed to
stimulus-incongruence, \(\beta\) = \(-0.14\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.6\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.99\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-85.84\), p = \(0\)) and
history-congruence (\(\beta\) = \(\ensuremath{-9.56\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.37\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.98\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-6.97\), p =
\(\ensuremath{3.15\times 10^{-12}}\)).

H. The mode of perceptual processing (i.e., the difference between the
smoothed probability of stimulus- vs.~history-congruence) showed a
quadratic relationship to RTs, with faster RTs for stronger biases
toward both external sensory information and internal predictions
provided by perceptual history (\(\beta_2\) = \(-19.86\) ± \(0.52\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.98\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-38.43\), p =
\(\ensuremath{5\times 10^{-323}}\)). The horizontal and vertical dotted
lines indicate maximum RT and the associated mode, respectively.

I. Confidence was enhanced for both stimulus-congruence (as opposed to
stimulus-incongruence, \(\beta\) = \(0.48\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.38\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.06\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(351.54\), p = \(0\)) and
history-congruence (\(\beta\) = \(0.04\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.18\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.06\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(36.85\), p =
\(\ensuremath{3.25\times 10^{-297}}\)).

J. In analogy to RTs, we found a quadratic relationship between the mode
of perceptual processing and confidence, which increased when both
externally- and internally-biased modes grew stronger (\(\beta_2\) =
\(39.3\) ± \(0.94\), T(\(\ensuremath{2.06\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(41.95\),
p = \(0\)). The horizontal and vertical dotted lines indicate minimum
confidence and the associated mode, respectively.

A. In mice, 81.37\% ± 0.3\% of trials were stimulus-congruent (in red)
and 54.03\% ± 0.17\% of trials were history-congruent (in blue; upper
panel). History-congruent perceptual choices were not a consequence of
the experimental design, but a source of error, as they were more
frequent on stimulus-incongruent trials (lower panel).

B. Relative to randomly permuted data, we found highly significant
autocorrelations of stimulus-congruence and history-congruence (dots
indicate intercepts \(\neq\) 0 in trial-wise linear mixed effects
modeling at p \textless{} 0.05). Please note that the negative
autocorrelation of stimulus-congruence at trial 2 was a consequence of
the experimental design (Supplemental Figure 2D-F). As in humans,
autocorrelation coefficients were best fit by an exponential function
(adjusted \(R^2\) for stimulus-congruence: \(0.44\); history-congruence:
\(0.52\)) as compared to a linear function (adjusted \(R^2\) for

C. For stimulus-congruence (upper panel), the lag of positive
autocorrelation was longer in comparison to humans (4.59 ± 0.06 on
average). For history-congruence (lower panel), the lag of positive
autocorrelation was slightly shorter relative to humans (2.58 ± 0.01 on

F. The average squared coherence between fluctuations in stimulus- and

G. We observed shorter trial durations (TDs) for stimulus-congruence (as

\(\ensuremath{8.53\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.34\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-131.78\), p = \(0\)), but

T(\(\ensuremath{1.35\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-32.31\), p =

dotted lines indicate maximum TD and the associated mode, respectively.

I. For TDs that differed from the median TD by no more than 1.5 x MAD
(median absolute distance\textsuperscript{49}), mice exhibited a
quadratic component in the relationship between the mode of sensory

\(843.74\), T(\(\ensuremath{1.19\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-2.34\), p =

\subsection{Internal mode processing is driven by choice history as
opposed to stimulus
history}\label{internal-mode-processing-is-driven-by-choice-history-as-opposed-to-stimulus-history}}

The main manuscript reports the effects of perceptual history, which we
defined as the impact of the choice at the preceding trial on the choice
at the current trial (henceforth \emph{choice history}). \emph{Stimulus
history}, which is defined as the impact of the stimulus presented at
the preceding trial on the choice at the present trial, represents an
alternative approach to this. Here, we compare the effects of choice
history to the effects of stimulus history.

We observed a significant bias toward stimulus history (humans: 49.76\%
± 0.1\% of trials, \(\beta\) = \(1.26\) ± \(0.94\), T(\(373.62\)) =
\(1.34\), p = \(0.18\); mice: 51.11\% ± 0.08\% of trials, T(164) = 13.4,
p = \(\ensuremath{3.86\times 10^{-28}}\)). The bias toward stimulus
history was smaller than the bias toward choice history (humans:
\(\beta\) = \(-3.53\) ± \(0.5\), T(\(66.53\)) = \(-7.01\), p =
\(\ensuremath{1.48\times 10^{-9}}\); mice: T(164) = -17.21, p =
\(\ensuremath{1.43\times 10^{-38}}\)).

The attraction of choices toward both preceding choices and stimuli is
expected, as perception was \emph{stimulus-congruent} on approximately
75\% of trials, causing choices and stimuli to be highly correlated. We
therefore compared the effects of choice history and stimulus history
after \emph{stimulus-incongruent} (i.e., \emph{error}) trials, since
those trials lead to opposite predictions regarding the perceptual
choice at the subsequent trial.

As expected from the findings presented in the main manuscript,
perceptual choices were attracted toward perceptual choices when the
inducing trial was stimulus-incongruent (i.e., a positive effect of
choice history; humans: \(\beta\) = \(0.19\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.4\times 10^{-4}}\), z =
\(\ensuremath{1.36\times 10^{3}}\), p = \(0\): mice: \(\beta\) =
\(0.92\) ± \(0.01\), z = \(88.82\), p = \(0\)). By contrast, perceptual
choices tended to be repelled away from the stimulus presented at
preceding stimulus-incongruent trial (i.e., a negative effect of
stimulus history; humans: \(\beta\) = \(-0.19\) ± \(0.01\), z =
\(-16.47\), p = \(\ensuremath{5.99\times 10^{-61}}\): mice: \(\beta\) =
\(-0.92\) ± \(0.01\), z = \(-88.76\), p = \(0\)). This repulsion of
choices away from stimuli presented at stimulus-incongruent trials
confirmed that choices (which are anti-correlated to stimuli at
stimulus-incongruent trials) were the primary driver of attracting
serial effects in perception.

In sum, the above results suggest that, in both humans and mice, serial
dependencies were better explained by the effects of choice history as
opposed to the effects of stimulus history. This aligns with a result
recently published for the IBL database, where mice were shown to follow
an \emph{action-kernel} as opposed to a \emph{stimulus-kernel} model
when integrating information across trials\textsuperscript{81}.

\subsection{Fluctuations between internal and external mode modulate
perceptual performance beyond the effect of general response
biases}\label{fluctuations-between-internal-and-external-mode-modulate-perceptual-performance-beyond-the-effect-of-general-response-biases}}

The hypothesis that perception cycles through opposing internally- and
externally-biased modes is motivated by the assumption that recurring
intervals of stronger perceptual history temporally reduce the
participants' sensitivity to external information. Importantly, the
history-dependent biases that characterize internal mode processing must
be differentiated from general response biases. In binary perceptual
decision-making, general response biases are defined by a propensity to
choose one of the two outcomes more often than the alternative. Indeed,
human participants selected the more frequent of the two possible
outcomes in 58.71\% ± 0.22\% of trials, and mice selected the more
frequent of the two possible outcomes in 54.6\% ± 0.3\% of trials.

Two caveats have to be considered to make sure that the effect of
history-congruence is distinct from the effect of general response
biases. First, history-congruent states become more likely for larger
response biases that cause an increasing imbalance in the likelihood of
the two outcomes (humans: \(\beta\) = \(0.24\) ±
\(\ensuremath{6.93\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.09\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(342.43\), p = \(0\); mice:
\(\beta\) = \(0.15\) ± \(\ensuremath{8.25\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.32\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(181.93\), p = \(0\)). One may
thus ask whether the autocorrelation of history-congruence could be
entirely driven by general response biases.

Importantly, our autocorrelation analyses account for general response
biases by computing group-level autocorrelations (Figure 2-4B) relative
to randomly permuted data (i.e., by subtracting the autocorrelation of
randomly permuted data from the raw autocorrelation curve). This
precludes that general response biases contribute to the observed
autocorrelation of history-congruence (see Supplemental Figure S5 for a
visualization of the correction procedure for simulated data with
general response biases ranging from 60 to 90\%).

Second, it may be argued that fluctuations in perceptual performance may
be solely driven by ongoing changes in the strength of general response
biases. To assess the links between dynamic fluctuations in
stimulus-congruence on the one hand and history-congruence as well as
general response bias on the other hand, we computed all variables as
dynamic probabilities in sliding windows of ± 5 trials (Figure 1C).
Linear mixed effects modeling indicated that fluctuations in
history-congruent biases were larger in amplitude than the corresponding
fluctuations in general response biases in humans (\(\beta_0\) =
\(0.03\) ± \(\ensuremath{7.34\times 10^{-3}}\), T(\(64.94\)) = \(4.46\),
p = \(\ensuremath{3.28\times 10^{-5}}\)), but slightly smaller in mice
(\(\beta_0\) = \(\ensuremath{-5.26\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{4.67\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.12\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(-11.28\), p =
\(\ensuremath{1.02\times 10^{-28}}\)).

Crucially, ongoing fluctuations in history-congruence had a significant
negative effect on stimulus-congruence (humans: \(\beta_1\) = \(-0.05\)
± \(\ensuremath{5.63\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.1\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-84.21\), p = \(0\); mice:
\(\beta_1\) = \(-0.12\) ± \(\ensuremath{7.17\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.34\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-168.39\), p = \(0\)) beyond
the effect of ongoing changes in general response biases (humans:
\(\beta_2\) = \(-0.06\) ± \(\ensuremath{5.82\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.1\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-103.51\), p = \(0\); mice:
\(\beta_2\) = \(-0.03\) ± \(\ensuremath{6.94\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.34\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-48.14\), p = \(0\)). In sum,
the above control analyses confirmed that, in both humans and mice, the
observed influence of preceding choices on perceptual decision-making
cannot be reduced to general response biases.

\subsection{Internal mode is characterized by lower thresholds as well
as by history-dependent changes in biases and
lapses}\label{internal-mode-is-characterized-by-lower-thresholds-as-well-as-by-history-dependent-changes-in-biases-and-lapses}}

Random or stereotypical responses may provide an alternative explanation
for the reduced sensitivity to external sensory information that we
attribute to internal mode processing. To test this hypothesis, we asked
whether history-independent changes in biases and lapses may provide an
alternative explanation of the reduced sensitivity during internal mode.

To this end, we estimated full and history-conditioned psychometric
curves to investigate how internal and external mode relate to biases
(i.e., the horizontal position of the psychometric curve), lapses (i.e.,
the asymptotes of the psychometric curve) and thresholds (i.e.,
1/sensitivity, estimated from the slope of the psychometric curve). We
used a maximum likelihood procedure to predict trial-wise choices \(y\)
(\(y = 0\) and \(y = 1\) for outcomes A and B respectively) from the
choice probabilities \(y_p\). \(y_p\) was computed from the
difficulty-weighted inputs \(s_w\) via a parametric error function
defined by the parameters \(\gamma\) (lower lapse), \(\delta\) (upper
lapse), \(\mu\) (bias) and \(t\) (threshold; see Methods for details):

\begin{equation}
y_p = \gamma + (1 - \gamma - \delta) *  (erf(\frac{s_w + \mu}{t}) + 1) / 2
\end{equation}

Under our main hypothesis that periodic reductions in sensitivity to
external information are driven by increases in the impact of perceptual
history, one would expect (i) a history-dependent increase in biases and
lapses (effects of perceptual history), and (ii), a history-independent
increase in threshold (reduced sensitivity to external information).
Conversely, if what we identified as internal mode processing was in
fact driven by random choices, one would expect (i), a
history-independent increase in lapses (choice randomness), (ii), no
change in bias (no effect of perceptual history), and (iii), reduced
thresholds (reduced sensitivity to external information).

Across all data provided by the Confidence database\textsuperscript{20}
(i.e., irrespective of the preceding perceptual choice \(y_{t-1}\)),
biases \(\mu\) were distributed around zero (-0.05 ± 0.03; \(\beta_0\) =
\(\ensuremath{7.37\times 10^{-3}}\) ± \(0.09\), T(\(36.8\)) = \(0.08\),
p = \(0.94\); Supplemental Figure 6A-B, upper panel). When conditioned
on perceptual history, biases \(\mu\) varied according to the preceding
perceptual choice, with negative biases for \(y_{t-1} = 0\) (-0.22 ±
0.04; \(\beta_0\) = \(0.56\) ± \(0.12\), T(\(43.39\)) = \(4.6\), p =
\(\ensuremath{3.64\times 10^{-5}}\); Supplemental Figure 6A-B, upper

= \(0.56\) ± \(0.12\), T(\(43.39\)) = \(4.6\), p =
\(\ensuremath{3.64\times 10^{-5}}\); Supplemental Figure 6A-B, lower

0.03) as compared to external mode (0.86 ± 0.02; \(\beta_0\) = \(-0.62\)
± \(0.07\), T(\(45.62\)) = \(-8.38\), p =
\(\ensuremath{8.59\times 10^{-11}}\); controlling for differences in
lapses and thresholds).

Lower and upper lapses amounted to \(\gamma\) = \(0.13\) ±
\(\ensuremath{2.83\times 10^{-3}}\) and \(\delta\) = \(0.1\) ±
\(\ensuremath{2.45\times 10^{-3}}\) (Supplemental Figure 6A, C and D).
Lapses were larger in internal mode (\(\gamma\) = \(0.17\) ±
\(\ensuremath{3.52\times 10^{-3}}\), \(\delta\) = \(0.14\) ±
\(\ensuremath{3.18\times 10^{-3}}\)) as compared to external mode

\(\ensuremath{5.94\times 10^{-12}}\); controlling for differences in
biases and thresholds).

Conditioning on the previous perceptual choice revealed that the
between-mode difference in lapse was not general, but depended on
perceptual history: For \(y_{t-1} = 0\), only higher lapses \(\delta\)
differed between internal and external mode (\(\beta_0\) = \(-0.1\) ±
\(\ensuremath{9.58\times 10^{-3}}\), T(\(36.87\)) = \(-10.16\), p =
\(\ensuremath{3.06\times 10^{-12}}\)), whereas lower lapses \(\gamma\)
did not (\(\beta_0\) = \(0.01\) ± \(\ensuremath{7.77\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(33.1\)) = \(1.61\), p = \(0.12\)). Vice versa, for \(y_{t-1} = 1\),
lower lapses \(\gamma\) differed between internal and external mode
(\(\beta_0\) = \(-0.11\) ± \(0.01\), T(\(40.11\)) = \(-9.59\), p =

did not (\(\beta_0\) = \(0.01\) ± \(\ensuremath{7.74\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(33.66\)) = \(1.58\), p = \(0.12\)).

Thresholds \(t\) were estimated at 3 ± 0.06 (Supplemental Figure 6A and
E). Thresholds \(t\) were larger in internal mode (3.66 ± 0.09) as
compared to external mode (2.02 ± 0.03; \(\beta_0\) = \(-1.77\) ±
\(0.25\), T(\(50.45\)) = \(-7.14\), p =
\(\ensuremath{3.48\times 10^{-9}}\); controlling for differences in
biases and lapses). In contrast to the bias \(\mu\) and the lapse rates
\(\gamma\) and \(\delta\), thresholds \(t\) were not modulated by
perceptual history (\(\beta_0\) = \(0.04\) ± \(0.06\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.97\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(0.73\), p = \(0.47\)).

When estimated based on the full dataset provided in the IBL

zero (\(\ensuremath{3.87\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{9.81\times 10^{-3}}\); T(164) = 0.39, p = \(0.69\);
Supplemental Figure 7A-B, upper panel). When conditioned on the
preceding perceptual choice, biases were negative for \(y_{t-1} = 0\)
(\(-0.02\) ± \(\ensuremath{8.7\times 10^{-3}}\); T(\(164) = -1.99\), p =
\(0.05\); Supplemental Figure 7A-B, middle panel) and positive for
\(y_{t-1} = 1\) (\(0.02\) ± \(\ensuremath{9.63\times 10^{-3}}\);
T(\(164\)) = \(1.91\), p = \(0.06\); Supplemental Figure 7A-B, lower

(\(0.14\) ± \(\ensuremath{7.96\times 10^{-3}}\)) as compared to external
mode (\(0.07\) ± \(\ensuremath{8.7\times 10^{-3}}\); \(\beta_0\) =
\(-0.18\) ± \(0.03\), T = \(-6.38\), p =
\(\ensuremath{1.77\times 10^{-9}}\); controlling for differences in
lapses and thresholds).

Lower and upper lapses amounted to \(\gamma\) = \(0.1\) ±
\(\ensuremath{4.35\times 10^{-3}}\) and \(\delta\) = \(0.11\) ±
\(\ensuremath{4.65\times 10^{-3}}\) (Supplemental Figure 7A, C and D).
Lapse rates were higher in internal mode (\(\gamma\) = \(0.15\) ±
\(\ensuremath{5.14\times 10^{-3}}\), \(\delta\) = \(0.16\) ±
\(\ensuremath{5.79\times 10^{-3}}\)) as compared to external mode

\(\ensuremath{4.91\times 10^{-57}}\); controlling for differences in
biases and thresholds).

For \(y_{t-1} = 0\), the difference between internal and external mode
was more pronounced for higher lapses \(\delta\) (T(164) = \(21.44\), p
= \(\ensuremath{1.93\times 10^{-49}}\)). Conversely, for
\(y_{t-1} = 1\), the difference between internal and external mode was
more pronounced for lower lapses \(\gamma\) (T(\(164\)) = \(-18.24\), p
= \(\ensuremath{2.68\times 10^{-41}}\)). In contrast to the human data,
higher lapses \(\delta\) and lower lapses \(\gamma\) were significantly
elevated during internal mode irrespective of the preceding perceptual
choice (higher lapses \(\delta\) for \(y_{t-1} = 1\): T(164) = -2.65, p
= \(\ensuremath{8.91\times 10^{-3}}\); higher lapses \(\delta\) for
\(y_{t-1} = 0\): T(164) = -28.29, p =
\(\ensuremath{5.62\times 10^{-65}}\); lower lapses \(\gamma\) for
\(y_{t-1} = 1\): T(164) = -32.44, p =
\(\ensuremath{2.92\times 10^{-73}}\); lower lapses \(\gamma\) for
\(y_{t-1} = 0\): T(164) = -2.5, p = \(0.01\)).

In mice, thresholds \(t\) amounted to \(0.15\) ±
\(\ensuremath{6.52\times 10^{-3}}\) (Supplemental Figure 7A and E) and
were higher in internal mode (\(0.27\) ± \(0.01\)) as compared to
external mode (\(0.09\) ± \(\ensuremath{4.44\times 10^{-3}}\);
\(\beta_0\) = \(-0.28\) ± \(0.04\), T = \(-7.26\), p =
\(\ensuremath{1.53\times 10^{-11}}\); controlling for differences in
biases and lapses). Thresholds \(t\) were not modulated by perceptual
history (T(164) = 0.94, p = \(0.35\)).

In sum, the above analyses showed that, in both humans and mice,
internal and external mode differ with respect to biases, lapses and
thresholds. Internally-biased processing was characterized by higher
thresholds, indicating a reduced sensitivity to sensory information, as
well as by larger biases and lapses. Importantly, between-mode
differences in biases and lapses strongly depended on perceptual
history. This confirmed that internal mode processing cannot be
explained solely on the ground of a general (i.e., history-independent)
increase in lapses or bias indicative of random of stereotypical
responses.

\subsection{Internal mode processing can not be reduced to insufficient
task
familiarity}\label{internal-mode-processing-can-not-be-reduced-to-insufficient-task-familiarity}}

It may be assumed that participants tend to repeat preceding choices
when they are not yet familiar with the experimental task, leading to
history-congruent choices that are caused by insufficient training. To
assess this alternative explanation, we contrasted the correlates of
bimodal inference with training effects in humans and mice.

\hypertarget{humans-1}{%
\subsubsection{Humans}\label{humans-1}}

In the Confidence database\textsuperscript{20}, training effects were
visible from RTs that were shortened by increasing exposure to the task
(\(\beta\) = \(\ensuremath{-7.53\times 10^{-5}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{6.32\times 10^{-7}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.81\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-119.15\), p = \(0\)).
Intriguingly, however, history-congruent choices became more frequent
with increased exposure to the task (\(\beta\) =
\(\ensuremath{3.6\times 10^{-5}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{2.54\times 10^{-6}}\), z = \(14.19\), p =
\(\ensuremath{10^{-45}}\)), speaking against the proposition that
insufficient training induces seriality in response behavior.

\hypertarget{mice-1}{%
\subsubsection{Mice}\label{mice-1}}

As in humans, it is an important caveat to consider whether the observed
serial dependencies in mice reflect a phenomenon of perceptual
inference, or, alternatively, an unspecific strategy that occurs at the
level of reporting behavior. We reasoned that, if mice indeed tended to
repeat previous choices as a general response pattern, history effects
should decrease during training of the perceptual task. We therefore
analyzed how stimulus- and history-congruent perceptual choices evolved
across sessions in mice that, by the end of training, achieved
proficiency (i.e., stimulus-congruence \(\geq\) 80\%) in the
\emph{basic} task of the IBL dataset\textsuperscript{21}.

Across sessions, we found that stimulus-congruent perceptual choices
became more frequent (\(\beta\) = \(0.34\) ±
\(\ensuremath{7.13\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{8.51\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(47.66\), p = \(0\)) and TDs
were progressively shortened (\(\beta\) = \(-22.14\) ± \(17.06\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.14\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(-1.3\), p = \(0\)). Crucially,
the frequency of history-congruent perceptual choices also increased
during training (\(\beta\) = \(0.13\) ±
\(\ensuremath{4.67\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{8.4\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(27.04\), p =
\(\ensuremath{1.96\times 10^{-154}}\); Supplemental Figure S8).\\
Within individual session, longer task exposure was associated with an
increase in history-congruence (\(\beta\) =
\(\ensuremath{3.6\times 10^{-5}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{2.54\times 10^{-6}}\), z = \(14.19\), p =
\(\ensuremath{10^{-45}}\)) and a decrease in TDs (\(\beta\) = \(-0.1\) ±
\(\ensuremath{3.96\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.34\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-24.99\), p =
\(\ensuremath{9.45\times 10^{-138}}\)). In sum, these findings strongly
argue against the proposition that mice show biases toward perceptual
history due to an unspecific response strategy.

\textbf{Supplemental Figure S2. Controlling for task difficulty and
external stimulation.}

In this study, we found highly significant autocorrelations of stimulus-
and history-congruence in humans as well as in mice, while controlling
for task difficulty and the sequence of external stimulation. Here, we
confirm that the autocorrelations of stimulus- and history-congruence
were not a trivial consequence of the experimental design or the
addition of tast difficulty and external stimulation as control
variables in the computation of group-level autocorrelations.

A. In humans, task difficulty (in green) showed a significant
autocorrelation starting at the 5th trial (upper panel, dots at the
bottom indicate intercepts \(\neq\) 0 in trial-wise linear mixed effects
modeling at p \textless{} 0.05). When controlling for task difficulty
only, linear mixed effects modeling indicated a significant
autocorrelation of stimulus-congruence (in red) for the first 3
consecutive trials (middle panel). 20\% of trials within the displayed
time window remained significantly autocorrelated. The autocorrelation
of history-congruence (in blue) remained significant for the first 11
consecutive trials (64\% significantly autocorrelated trials within the
displayed time window). At the level of individual participants, the
autocorrelation of task difficulty exceeded the respective
autocorrelation of randomly permuted within a lag of \(21.66\) ±
\(\ensuremath{8.37\times 10^{-3}}\) trials (lower panel).

B. In humans, the sequence of external stimulation (i.e., which of the
two binary outcomes was supported by the presented stimuli; depicted in
green) was negatively autocorrelated for 1 trial. When controlling for
the autocorrelation of external stimulation only, stimulus-congruence
remained significantly autocorrelated for 22 consecutive trials (88\% of
trials within the displayed time window; lower panel) and
history-congruence remained significantly autocorrelated for 20
consecutive trials (84\% of trials within the displayed time window). At
the level of individual participants, the autocorrelation of external
stimulation exceeded the respective autocorrelation of randomly permuted
within a lag of \(2.94\) ± \(\ensuremath{4.4\times 10^{-3}}\)
consecutive trials (lower panel).

C. In mice, task difficulty showed a significant autocorrelated for the
first 25 consecutive trials (upper panel). When controlling only for
task difficulty only, linear mixed effects modeling indicated a
significant autocorrelation of stimulus-congruence for the first 36
consecutive trials (middle panel). In total, 100\% of trials within the
displayed time window remained significantly autocorrelated. The
autocorrelation of history-congruence remained significant for the first
8 consecutive trials, with 84\% significantly autocorrelated trials
within the displayed time window. At the level of individual mice,
autocorrelation coefficients for difficulty were elevated above randomly
permuted data within a lag of 15.13 ± 0.19 consecutive trials (lower
panel).

D. In mice, the sequence of external stimulation (i.e., which of the two
binary outcomes was supported by the presented stimuli) was negatively
autocorrelated for 11 consecutive trials (upper panel). When controlling
only for the autocorrelation of external stimulation,
stimulus-congruence remained significantly autocorrelated for 86
consecutive trials (100\% of trials within the displayed time window;
middle) and history-congruence remained significantly autocorrelated for
8 consecutive trials (84\% of trials within the displayed time window).
At the level of individual mice, autocorrelation coefficients for
external stimulation were elevated above randomly permuted data within a

\textbf{Supplemental Figure S3. Reproducing group-level autocorrelations
using logistic regression.}

A. As an alternative to group-level autocorrelation coefficients, we
used trial-wise logistic regression to quantify serial dependencies in
stimulus- and history-congruence. This analysis predicted stimulus- and
history-congruence at the index trial (trial \(t = 0\), vertical line)
based on stimulus- and history-congruence at the 100 preceding trials.
Mirroring the shape of the group-level autocorrelations, trial-wise
regression coefficients (depicted as mean ± SEM, dots mark trials with
regression weights significantly greater than zero at p \textless{}
0.05) increased toward the index trial \(t = 0\) for the human data.

B. Following our results in human data, regression coefficients that
predicted history-congruence at the index trial (trial t = 0, vertical
line) increased exponentially for trials closer to the index trial in
mice. In contrast to history-congruence, stimulus-congruence showed a
negative regression weight (or autocorrelation coefficient; Figure 3B)
at trial -2. This was due to the experimental design (see also the
autocorrelations of difficulty and external stimulation in Supplemental
Figure S2C and D): When mice made errors at easy trials (contrast
\(\geq\) 50\%), the upcoming stimulus was shown at the same spatial
location and at high contrast. This increased the probability of
stimulus-congruent perceptual choices after stimulus-incongruent
perceptual choices at easy trials, thereby creating a negative
regression weight (or autocorrelation coefficient) of
stimulus-congruence at trial -2.

regression.}

A. To ensure that perceptual history played a significant role in
perception despite the ongoing stream of external information, we tested
whether human perceptual decision-making was better explained by the
combination of external and internal information or, alternatively, by
external information alone. To this end, we compared AIC between
logistic regression models that predicted trial-wise perceptual
responses either by both current external sensory information and the
preceding percept, or by external sensory information alone (values
above zero indicate a superiority of the full model). With high
consistency across the experiments selected from the Confidence
Database, this model-comparison confirmed that perceptual history
contributed significantly to perception (difference in AIC = 8.07 ±
0.53, T(\(57.22\)) = \(4.1\), p = \(\ensuremath{1.31\times 10^{-4}}\)).

B. Participant-wise regression coefficients amount to 0.18 ± 0.02 for
the effect of perceptual history and 2.51 ± 0.03 for external sensory
stimulation.

C. In mice, an AIC-based model comparison indicated that perception was
better explained by logistic regression models that predicted trial-wise

\textbf{Supplemental Figure S5. Correcting for general response biases.}

Here, we ask whether the autocorrelation of history-congruence (as shown
in Figure 2-3C) may be driven by general response biases (i.e., a
general propensity to choose one of the two possible outcomes more
frequently than the alternative). To this end, we generated sequences of
100 perceptual choices with general response biases ranging from 60 to
90\% for 1000 simulated participants each. We then computed the
autocorrelation of history-congruence for these simulated data.
Crucially, we used the correction procedure that is applied to the
autocorrelation curves shown in this manuscript: All reported
autocorrelation coefficients are computed relative to the average
autocorrelation coefficients obtained for 100 iterations of randomly
permuted trial sequences. The above simulation show that this correction
procedure removes any potential contribution of general response biases
to the autocorrelation of history-congruence. This indicates that the
autocorrelation of history-congruence (as shown in Figure 2-3C) is not
driven by general response biases that were present in the empirical
data at a level of 58.71\% ± 0.22\% in humans and 54.6\% ± 0.3\% in
mice.

observed negative biases for \(y_{t-1} = 0\) (\(\beta_0\) = \(0.56\) ±
\(0.12\), T(\(43.39\)) = \(4.6\), p =

T(\(47.03\)) = \(-9.11\), p = \(\ensuremath{5.94\times 10^{-12}}\);
controlling for differences in biases and thresholds; see upper panel
and subplot D). Importantly, the between-mode difference in lapses
depended on perceptual history: We found no significant difference in
lower lapses \(\gamma\) for \(y_{t-1} = 0\) (\(\beta_0\) = \(0.01\) ±
\(\ensuremath{7.77\times 10^{-3}}\), T(\(33.1\)) = \(1.61\), p =

\(y_{t-1} = 1\) (\(\beta_0\) = \(-0.11\) ± \(0.01\), T(\(40.11\)) =
\(-9.59\), p = \(\ensuremath{6.14\times 10^{-12}}\); lower panel).

D. Conversely, higher lapses \(\delta\) were significantly increased for
\(y_{t-1} = 0\) (\(\beta_0\) = \(-0.1\) ±
\(\ensuremath{9.58\times 10^{-3}}\), T(\(36.87\)) = \(-10.16\), p =
\(\ensuremath{3.06\times 10^{-12}}\); middle panel), but not for
\(y_{t-1} = 1\) (\(\beta_0\) = \(0.01\) ±
\(\ensuremath{7.74\times 10^{-3}}\), T(\(33.66\)) = \(1.58\), p =
\(0.12\); lower panel).

E. The thresholds \(t\) were larger in internal as compared to external
mode (\(\beta_0\) = \(-1.77\) ± \(0.25\), T(\(50.45\)) = \(-7.14\), p =
\(\ensuremath{3.48\times 10^{-9}}\); controlling for differences in

(\(\beta_0\) = \(0.04\) ± \(0.06\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.97\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(0.73\), p = \(0.47\)).

\textbf{Supplemental Figure S7. Full and history-conditioned
psychometric functions across modes in mice.}

A. Here, we show average psychometric functions for the full IBL dataset
(upper panel) and conditioned on perceptual history (\(y_{t-1} = 1\) and
\(y_{t-1} = 0\); middle and lower panel) across modes (green line) and
for internal mode (blue line) and external mode (red line) separately.

B. Across the full dataset, biases \(\mu\) were distributed around zero
(T(164) = 0.39, p = \(0.69\); upper panel), with larger absolute biases
\(|\mu|\) for internal as compared to external mode (\(\beta_0\) =
\(-0.18\) ± \(0.03\), T = \(-6.38\), p =

observed negative biases for \(y_{t-1} = 0\) (T(164) = -1.99, p =
\(0.05\); middle panel) and positive biases for \(y_{t-1} = 1\) (T(164)

C. Lapse rates were higher in internal as compared to external mode
(\(\beta_0\) = \(-0.11\) ± \(\ensuremath{4.39\times 10^{-3}}\), T =

more pronounced for lower lapses \(\gamma\) (T(164) = -18.24, p =

\(\delta\) (see subplot D). In mice, lower lapses \(\gamma\) were
significantly elevated during internal mode irrespective of the
preceding perceptual choice (middle panel: lower lapses \(\gamma\) for

Here, we depict the progression of history- and stimulus-congruence
(depicted in blue and red, respectively; left panel) as well as TDs (in
green; right panel) across training sessions in mice that achieved
proficiency (i.e., stimulus-congruence \(\geq\) 80\%) in the

T(\(\ensuremath{8.4\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(27.04\), p =

model against reduced control models.}

A. Group-level AIC. The bimodal inference model (M1) achieved the lowest
AIC across the full model space (\(AIC_1\) =
\(\ensuremath{8.16\times 10^{4}}\) in humans and
\(\ensuremath{4.24\times 10^{4}}\) in mice). Model M2 (\(AIC_2\) =
\(\ensuremath{9.76\times 10^{4}}\) in humans and
\(\ensuremath{4.91\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) and Model M3 (\(AIC_3\) =
\(\ensuremath{1.19\times 10^{5}}\) in humans and
\(\ensuremath{5.95\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) incorporated only
oscillations of either likelihood or prior precision. Model M4
(\(AIC_4\) = \(\ensuremath{1.69\times 10^{5}}\) in humans and
\(\ensuremath{9.12\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) lacked any oscillations of
likelihood and prior precision and corresponded to the normative model
proposed by Glaze et al.\textsuperscript{51}. In model M5 (\(AIC_4\) =
\(\ensuremath{2.01\times 10^{5}}\) in humans and
\(\ensuremath{1.13\times 10^{5}}\) in mice), we furthermore removed the
integration of information across trials, such that perception depended
only in incoming sensory information.

B. Subject-level AIC. Here, we show the distribution of AIC values at
the subject-level. AIC for the bimodal inference model tended to be
smaller than AIC for the comparator models (statistical comparison to
the second-best model M2 in humans: \(\beta\) = \(-1.71\) ± \(0.19\),
T(\(\ensuremath{8.57\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(-8.85\), p =

\textbf{Supplemental Figure S10. Reduced Control Model M2: Only
oscillation of the likelihood.} When simulating data for the
\emph{likelihood-oscillation-only model}, we removed the oscillation
from the prior term by setting the amplitude \(a_{\psi}\) to zero.
Simulated data thus depended only on the participant-wise estimates for
hazard rate \(H\), amplitude \(a_{LLR}\), frequency \(f\), phase \(p\)
and inverse decision temperature \(\zeta\).

A. Similar to the full model M1 (Figure 1F and Figure 4), simulated
perceptual choices were stimulus-congruent in 71.97\% ± 0.17\% of trials
(in red). History-congruent amounted to 50.76\% ± 0.07\% of trials (in
blue). As in the full model, the likelihood-oscillation-only model
showed a significant bias toward perceptual history
T(\ensuremath{4.32\times 10^{3}}) = 10.29, p =
\(\ensuremath{1.54\times 10^{-24}}\); upper panel). Similarly,
history-congruent choices were more frequent at error trials
(T(\ensuremath{4.32\times 10^{3}}) = 9.71, p =
\(\ensuremath{4.6\times 10^{-22}}\); lower panel).

B. In the likelihood-oscillation-only model, we observed that the
autocorrelation coefficients for history-congruence were reduced below
the autocorrelation coefficients of stimulus-congruence. This is an
approximately five-fold reduction relative to the empirical results
observed in humans (Figure 2B), where the autocorrelation of
history-congruence was above the autocorrelation of stimulus-congruence.
Moreover, in the reduced model shown here, the number of consecutive
trials that showed significant autocorrelation of history-congruence was
reduced to 11.

C. In the likelihood-oscillation-only model, the number of consecutive
trials at which true autocorrelation coefficients exceeded the
autocorrelation coefficients for randomly permuted data did not differ
with respect to stimulus-congruence (2.62 ±
\ensuremath{1.39\times 10^{-3}} trials;
T(\ensuremath{4.32\times 10^{3}}) = 1.85, p = \(0.06\)), but decreased
with respect to history-congruence (2.4 ±
\ensuremath{8.45\times 10^{-4}} trials;
T(\ensuremath{4.32\times 10^{3}}) = -15.26, p =
\(\ensuremath{3.11\times 10^{-51}}\)) relative to the full model.

D. In the likelihood-oscillation-only model, the smoothed probabilities
of stimulus- and history-congruence (sliding windows of ±5 trials)
fluctuated as a scale-invariant process with a 1/f power law, i.e., at
power densities that were inversely proportional to the frequency (power
\textasciitilde{} 1/\(f^\beta\); stimulus-congruence: \(\beta\) =
\(-0.81\) ± \(\ensuremath{1.17\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.92\times 10^{5}}\)) = \(-688.65\), p = \(0\);
history-congruence: \(\beta\) = \(-0.79\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.14\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.92\times 10^{5}}\)) = \(-698.13\), p = \(0\)).

E. In the likelihood-oscillation-only model, the distribution of phase
shift between fluctuations in simulated stimulus- and history-congruence
peaked at half a cycle (\(\pi\) denoted by dotted line). In contrast to
the full model, the dynamic probabilities of simulated stimulus- and
history-congruence were positively correlated (\(\beta\) =
\(\ensuremath{2.7\times 10^{-3}}\) ± \(\ensuremath{7.6\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.02\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(3.55\), p =
\(\ensuremath{3.8\times 10^{-4}}\)).

F. In the likelihood-oscillation-only model, the average squared
coherence between fluctuations in simulated stimulus- and
history-congruence (black dotted line) was reduced in comparison to the
full model (T(\ensuremath{3.51\times 10^{3}}) = -4.56, p =
\(\ensuremath{5.27\times 10^{-6}}\)) and amounted to 3.43 ±
\ensuremath{1.02\times 10^{-3}}\%.

G. Similar to the full bimodal inference model, confidence simulated
from the likelihood-oscillation-only model was enhanced for
stimulus-congruent choices (\(\beta\) = \(0.03\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.42\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.1\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(191.78\), p = \(0\)) and
history-congruent choices (\(\beta\) =
\(\ensuremath{9.1\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.25\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.1\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(72.51\), p = \(0\)).

H. In the likelihood-oscillation-only model, the positive quadratic
relationship between the mode of perceptual processing and confidence
was markedly reduced in comparison to the full model (\(\beta_2\) =
\(0.34\) ± \(0.1\), T(\(\ensuremath{2.1\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(3.49\), p =
\(\ensuremath{4.78\times 10^{-4}}\)). The horizontal and vertical dotted

history-congruence (1.85 ± \ensuremath{3.49\times 10^{-4}} trials;
T(\ensuremath{4.32\times 10^{3}}) = -19.37, p =
\(\ensuremath{3.49\times 10^{-80}}\)) relative to the full model.

D. In the no-evidence-accumulation model, the smoothed probabilities of
stimulus- and history-congruence (sliding windows of ±5 trials)
fluctuated as a scale-invariant process with a 1/f power law, i.e., at
power densities that were inversely proportional to the frequency (power
\textasciitilde{} 1/\(f^\beta\); stimulus-congruence: \(\beta\) =
\(-0.82\) ± \(\ensuremath{1.2\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.92\times 10^{5}}\)) = \(-681.98\), p = \(0\);
history-congruence: \(\beta\) = \(-0.78\) ±
\(\ensuremath{1.11\times 10^{-3}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{1.92\times 10^{5}}\)) = \(-706.57\), p = \(0\)).

E. In the no-evidence-accumulation model, the distribution of phase
shift between fluctuations in simulated stimulus- and history-congruence
peaked at half a cycle (\(\pi\) denoted by dotted line). In contrast to
the full model, the dynamic probabilities of simulated stimulus- and
history-congruence were not significantly anti-correlated (\(\beta\) =
\(\ensuremath{6.39\times 10^{-4}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{7.22\times 10^{-4}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{8.89\times 10^{5}}\)) = \(0.89\), p = \(0.38\)).

F. In the no-evidence-accumulation model, the average squared coherence
between fluctuations in simulated stimulus- and history-congruence
(black dotted line) was reduced in comparison to the full model
(T(\ensuremath{3.56\times 10^{3}}) = -9.96, p =
\(\ensuremath{4.63\times 10^{-23}}\)) and amounted to 2.8 ±
\ensuremath{7.29\times 10^{-4}}\%.

G. Similar to the full bimodal inference model, confidence simulated
from the no-evidence-accumulation model was enhanced for
stimulus-congruent choices (\(\beta\) = \(0.01\) ±
\(\ensuremath{9.4\times 10^{-5}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.11\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(158.1\), p = \(0\)). In
contrast to the full bimodal inference model, history-congruent choices
were not characterized by enhanced confidence (\(\beta\) =
\(\ensuremath{8.78\times 10^{-5}}\) ±
\(\ensuremath{8.21\times 10^{-5}}\),
T(\(\ensuremath{2.11\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(1.07\), p = \(0.29\)).

H. In the no-evidence-accumulation model, the positive quadratic
relationship between the mode of perceptual processing and confidence
was markedly reduced in comparison to the full model (\(\beta_2\) =
\(0.19\) ± \(0.06\), T(\(\ensuremath{2.11\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(3\), p =
\(\ensuremath{2.69\times 10^{-3}}\)). The horizontal and vertical dotted
lines indicate minimum posterior certainty and the associated mode,
respectively.

\subsection{Reviewer 1}\label{reviewer-1}}

\textbf{This was an interesting and thought-provoking submission. I note
that it is a revision: I am therefore supposing that the authors have
already responded to one round of reviewer comments and that you are
potentially interested in publishing this work. In brief, I think there
are many elements of this report that warrant publication; however,
there are some parts that are less compelling and could be deferred to a
subsequent paper. The paper is far too long and would benefit greatly
from being streamlined. Furthermore, some of the modeling is
overengineered and is difficult to follow. I have tried to suggest how
the authors might improve the presentation of their work in my comments
to authors.}

\textbf{I enjoyed reading this long but thought-provoking report of
fluctuations in the sensitivity to sensory evidence in perceptual
decision-making tasks. There were some parts of this report that were
compelling and interesting. Other parts were less convincing and
difficult to understand. Overall, this paper is far too long. An analogy
that might help here is that a dinner guest is very entertaining for the
first hour or so - and then overstays their welcome; until you start
wishing they would leave. Another analogy, which came to mind, was that
the modeling---and its interpretation---was a bit autistic (i.e., lots
of fascinating if questionable detail with a lack of central
coherence).}

\textbf{I think that both issues could be resolved by shortening the
paper and removing (or, at least, greatly simplifying) the final
simulation studies of metacognition. I try to unpack this suggestion in
the following.}

We would like to thank Prof.~Friston for the very insightful and helpful
comments on our manuscript. We fully agree that our ideas about the
computational function of between-mode fluctuations and the associated
simulations may be presented in a more accessible form in a standalone
paper. As we outlined in more detail below, we have streamlined our
findings and rewrote the paper and reduced it's length by shortening the
sections on computational modeling. We have also followed
Prof.~Friston's suggestion to interpret the effects of mode on RT and
confidence in the context of predictive processing definitions of
attention, namely the allocation of precision between prior and
likelihood.

\textbf{Major points:}

\textbf{As I understand it, you have used publicly available data on
perceptual decision-making to demonstrate slow fluctuations in the
tendency to predicate perceptual decisions on the stimuli and on the
history of recent decisions. You find scale-free fluctuations in this
tendency --- that are anti-correlated --- and interpret this as
fluctuations in the precision afforded sensory evidence, relative to
prior beliefs. This interpretation is based upon a model of serial
dependencies (parameterised with a hazard function).}

\textbf{The stimulus and history (i.e., likelihood and prior)
sensitivities are anti-correlated and both show scale free behavior.
This is reproduced in men and mice. You then proceed to model this with
periodic fluctuations in the precisions or weights applied to the
likelihood and prior that are in anti-phase - and then estimate the
parameters of the ensuing model. Finally, you then simulate the learning
of the hazard parameter --- and something called metacognition - to show
that periodic fluctuations improve estimates of metacognition (based
upon a Rescorla-Wagner model of learning). You motivate this by
suggesting that the fluctuations in sensitivity are somehow necessary to
elude circular inference and provide better estimates of precision.}

\textbf{Note that I am reading the parameters omega\_LLR and omega\_psi
as the precision of the likelihood and prior, where the precision of the
likelihood is called sensory precision. This contrasts with your use of
sensory precision, which seems to be attributed to a metacognitive
construct M.}

\textbf{As noted above, all of this is fascinating but there are too
many moving parts that do not fit together comfortably. I will list a
few examples:}

\hypertarget{comment-1}{%
\subsubsection{Comment 1}\label{comment-1}}

\textbf{If, empirically, the fluctuations in sensitivity are scale-free
with a 1/f power law, why did you elect to model fluctuations in
precision as a periodic function with one unique timescale (i.e., f).?}

The reason for choosing a unique timescale \(f\) was to enable our model
to depict the dominant timescale at which prior and likelihood precision
fluctuate in their impact on perceptual decision-making, giving rise to
between-mode fluctuations. We think that identifying this timescale is
important for planning future experiments targeted at between-mode
fluctuations and their manipulation by causal interventions (e.g.,
pharmacology or TMS). The posterior value for \(f\) lies at
approximately 0.11 1/\(N_{trials}\) in both humans and mice. The value
of \(f\) approximately matches the transition probabilities between
\emph{engaged} and \emph{disengaged} states in work assessing
fluctuations in perceptual decision-making using Hidden Markov models
(stay probabilities ranged between 0.94 and 0.98, see Ashwood et al.,
Nature Neuroscience 2022). Simulating from our model (Figure 4)
replicates the 1/f feature of the empirical data. Please note that the
individual trial is the smallest unit of \emph{measurement} for these
fluctuations, such that our analysis is limited by definition to
frequencies below 1 (1/\(N_{trials}\)).

We now provide a rationale for choosing one value for \(f\) -
identifying the dominant timescale for fluctuations in mode - in the
results section:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  To allow for \emph{bimodal inference}, i.e., alternating periods of
  internally- and externally-biased modes of perceptual processing that
  occur irrespective of the sequence of preceding experiences, we
  assumed that likelihood and prior vary in their influence on the
  perceptual decision according to fluctuations governed by
  \(\omega_{LLR}\) and \(\omega_{\psi}\). These anti-phase sine
  functions (defined by amplitudes \(a_{LLR/\psi}\), frequency \(f\) and
  phase \(p\)) determine the precision afforded to the likelihood and
  prior\textsuperscript{53}. The implicit anti-phase fluctuations are
  mandated by Bayes-optimal formulations in which inference depends only
  on the relative values of prior and likelihood precision (i.e., the
  Kalman gain\textsuperscript{54}). As such, \(\omega_{LLR}\) and
  \(\omega_{\psi}\) implement a hyperprior\textsuperscript{55} in which
  the likelihood and prior precisions are shifted against each other at
  a dominant timescale defined by \(f\): (\ldots)
\item
  (\ldots) The parameter \(f\) captures the dominant time scale at which
  likelihood (amplitude humans: \(a_{LLR}\) = \(0.5\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{2.02\times 10^{-4}}\); mice: \(a_{LLR}\) = \(0.39\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{1.08\times 10^{-3}}\) and prior precision (amplitude
  humans: \(a_{\psi}\) = \(1.44\) ± \(\ensuremath{5.27\times 10^{-4}}\);
  mice: \(a_{\psi}\) = \(1.71 ± \ensuremath{7.15\times 10^{-3}}\) were
  shifted against each other and was estimated at \(0.11\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{1.68\times 10^{-5}}\) 1/\(N_{trials}\) and
  \(0.11 ± \ensuremath{1.63\times 10^{-4}}\) 1/\(N_{trials}\) in mice.
\item
  Table 2 (see response to Comment 22 by Reviewer 1) contains an
  additional definition for all model parameters, including \(f\).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{comment-2}{%
\subsubsection{Comment 2}\label{comment-2}}

\textbf{At present, the estimates of meta-cognition (M) play the role of
accumulated estimates of (sensory or prior) precision. Why are these not
used in your model of perceptual decisions in Equation 2.}

In our model, the parameter \(\alpha\) controls the encoding precision
by governing the transformation from sensory stimuli to the log
likelihood ratio (LLR) via the equations (13-16) (the LLR ends up closer
to zero when \(\alpha\) is low). Our simulations on the adaptive
benefits of bimodal inference rest on the assumption that \(\alpha\) may
change unpredictably. The construct \(M\) is a belief about \(\alpha\)
that may be useful for, e.g., communicating the precision of sensory
encoding to other cognitive domains or agents. To our mind, \(\alpha\)
is a feature of low-level sensory encoding that cannot be modulated by
top-down beliefs such as \(M\). This is why we did not include \(M\) in
equation (2). Please note that we have removed this section following
Comment 9 of Reviewer 1.

\hypertarget{comment-3}{%
\subsubsection{Comment 3}\label{comment-3}}

\textbf{Why do you assume that non-specific increases in attention and
arousal will increase reaction times? If one has very precise prior
beliefs (and is not attending to stimuli), would you not expect a
decrease in reaction time?}

Thanks a lot for pointing this out (see also the Comment below and
Comment 6 by Reviewer 3). Both high prior and high likelihood precision
lead to higher absolute values of the log posterior ratio (reflecting
certainty encoded by the decision variable), and thus faster RTs. This
is reflected empirically by RTs in humans (Figure 2) and to a lesser
degree in mice (Figure 3): RTs tended to be shorter for stronger biases
toward both external and internal mode. Our model, which incorporates
(i), the accumulation of information across trials, and (ii),
fluctuations in the likelihood precision relative to the prior
precision, recapitulates this feature of the data, which is lost or
greatly attenuated when eliminating process (i) and/or (ii) (see model
comparison and simulations below). Our data thus confirm the hypothesis
that both high prior and likelihood precision lead to faster RTs.

In the previous version of the manuscript, we had included the relation
between mode and RTs and confidence primarily as a defensive analysis
against the proposition that what we call between-mode fluctuations is
not a perceptual phenomenon, but occurs downstream of perception. One
may imagine that fluctuations in perceptual performance are not
influenced by periods of relative increases in prior precision (which
decrease performance in fully randomized designs), but by periods when
participants do not attend to the task at all, i.e., neither to sensory
information nor to prior precision. We propose that the analyses of RTs
and confidence can give some insight into whether such alternative
mechanisms may be at play, as we would assume longer RTs and lower
confidence if participants failed to attend to the task at all.

That being said, we realize that, due to the potential non-linearity in
their relation to arousal (see also Comment 6 by Reviewer 3), RTs and
confidence cannot provide a definitive map of where fluctuations in mode
are situated in relation to arousal. Such a delineation may potentially
be provided by tracking of pupil size, response behavior or by neural
data (e.g., noise correlations of fluctuations in LFP). These data are
not available for the studies in the Confidence Database, but were very
recently published for the IBL database (after this manuscript was
submitted). While we believe that this is beyond the scope of this
manuscript, we will assess the relation of pupil diameter, motor
behavior (turning of the response wheel) and LFPs to between-mode
fluctuations in a future publication using the IBL dataset.

In light of the considerations above and our response to Comment 6 by
Reviewer 3, we now refer to attention in the predictive processing
sense. We use the term ``task engagement'' instead of ``on-task
attention'' to refer to situation in which participants may not attend
to the task at all, e.g.~due to low arousal or fatigue, and discuss
these as alternative explanations for between-mode fluctuations. We have
made three sets of changes to our manuscript:

First, we present our results on the relation of mode to RT and
Confidence in a more descriptive way, and do not use it as a strong
defensive analysis against arousal:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The above results point to systematic fluctuations in the
  \emph{decision variable}\textsuperscript{44} that determines
  perceptual choices, causing enhanced sensitivity to external stimulus
  information during external mode and increased biases toward preceding
  choices during internal mode. As such, fluctuations in mode should
  influence downstream aspects of behavior and cognition that operate on
  the perceptual decision variable\textsuperscript{44}. To test this
  hypothesis with respect to motor behavior and metacognition, we asked
  how bimodal inference relates to response times (RTs) and confidence
  reports. (\ldots.)
\item
  (\ldots) In sum, the above results indicate that reporting behavior
  and metacognition do not map linearly onto the mode of sensory
  processing. Rather, they suggest that slow fluctuations in the
  respective impact of external and internal information are most likely
  to affect perception at an early level of sensory
  analysis\textsuperscript{46,47}. Such low-level processing may thus
  integrate perceptual history with external inputs into a decision
  variable\textsuperscript{44} that influences not only perceptual
  choices, but also the speed and confidence at which they are made.
\item
  In what follows, we probe alternative explanations for between-mode
  fluctuations, test for the existence of modes in mice, and propose a
  predictive processing model that explains fluctuations in mode by
  ongoing shifts in the precision afforded to external sensory
  information relative to internal predictions driven by perceptual
  history.
\end{itemize}

Second, we have re-written our discussion of the quadratic relationship
of mode to RTs and Confidence, focusing on predictive processing models
of attention: - As a functional explanation for bimodal inference, we
propose that perception temporarily disengages from internal predictions
to form stable inferences about the statistical properties of the
sensory environment. Between-mode fluctuations may thus elude circular
inferences that occur when both the causes and the encoding of sensory
stimuli are volatile\textsuperscript{19,57}. By the same token, we
suggest that fluctuations in mode occur at the level of perceptual
processing\textsuperscript{26,30,46,47}, and are not a passive
phenomenon that is primarily driven by factors situated up- or
downstream of sensory analysis.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How does attention relate to between-mode fluctuations? According to
  predictive processing, attention corresponds to the precision afforded
  to the probability distributions that underlie perceptual
  inference\textsuperscript{53}. From this perspective, fluctuations
  between external and internal mode can be understood as ongoing shifts
  in the attention afforded to either external sensory information
  (regulated via likelihood precision) or internal predictions
  (regulated via prior precision). When the precision of either
  likelihood or prior increases, posterior precision increases, which
  leads to faster RTs and higher confidence. Therefore, when defined
  from the perspective of predictive processing as the precision
  afforded to likelihood and prior\textsuperscript{53}, fluctuations in
  attention may provide a plausible explanation for the quadratic
  relationship of mode to RTs and confidence (Figure 2H and J; Figure
  3I; Figure 3I).
\end{itemize}

Third, we have added a more general discussion of our findings in the
light of fluctuations in task engagement:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Outside of the predictive processing field, attention is often
  understood in the context of task engagement\textsuperscript{63},
  which varies according to the availability of cognitive resources that
  are modulated by factors such as tonic arousal, familiarity with the
  task, or fatigue\textsuperscript{63}. Our results suggest that
  internal mode processing cannot be completely reduced to intervals of
  low task engagement: In addition to shorter RTs and elevated
  confidence, choices during internal mode were not random or globally
  biased, but driven by perceptual history (Supplemental Figures S6-7).
  Moreover, our computational model identified the dominant timescale of
  between-mode fluctuations at 0.11 1/\(N_{trials}\), which may be
  compatible with fluctuations in arousal\textsuperscript{64}, but is
  faster than to be expected for the development of task familiarity or
  fatigue.
\item
  However, in interpreting the impact of between-mode fluctuations on
  perceptual accuracy, speed of response and confidence, it is important
  to consider that global modulators such as tonic arousal are known to
  have non-linear effects on task performance\textsuperscript{65}: In
  perceptual tasks, performance seems so be highest during mid-level
  arousal, whereas low- and high-level arousal lead to reduced accuracy
  and slower responses\textsuperscript{65}. This contrasts with the
  effects of bimodal inference, where accuracy increases linearly as one
  moves from internal to external mode, and responses become faster at
  both ends of the mode spectrum.
\item
  Of note, high phasic arousal has been shown to suppress multi-domain
  biases in decision-making in humans and mice\textsuperscript{66--68},
  including the biases toward perceptual history\textsuperscript{28}
  that we implicate in internal mode processing. The increase in
  response speed and history congruence over time (Supplemental Section
  9.4) may argue against insufficient training as an alternative
  explanation for internal mode processing, but may also taken as a sign
  of waning arousal. The multiple mechanistic mappings to RTs and
  confidence therefore warrant more direct measures of arousal (such as
  pupil size\textsuperscript{28,65,66,68--70}, motor
  behavior\textsuperscript{69,70}, or neural data\textsuperscript{71})
  to better delineate bimodal inference from fluctuations in global
  modulators of task performance.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{comment-4}{%
\subsubsection{Comment 4}\label{comment-4}}

\textbf{In the predictive processing literature, attention is thought to
correspond to fluctuations in sensory and prior precision. Why did you
then consider attention as some additional or unrelated confound?}

This point is closely related to the comment above. We realize that, in
the predictive processing field, attention is equated with the precision
of probability distributions that contribute to the perceptual decision,
such that an observer can attend strongly to sensory information (high
likelihood precision) or to internal predictions derived from the
sequence of preceding percepts (high prior precision). Therefore, when
following the above predictive processing definition, fluctuations in
attention can be equated with fluctuations in mode.

However, we feel that outside of the predictive processing field,
attention is not always conceived in that way, such that low attention
is often considered as low engagement with the task, i.e., relating to
low likelihood and low prior precision in the predictive processing
sense. It is against these caveats that our control analysis (based on
psychometric functions, training effects, RTs and confidence) defend our
conclusions on bimodal inference.

We now provide a more nuanced interpretation of our findings of RTs and
confidence in relation to attention, with a specific focus on predictive
processing and precision. We hope that our responses to the comment
above resolve the points raised in this comment.

\hypertarget{comment-5}{%
\subsubsection{Comment 5}\label{comment-5}}

\textbf{What licences the assumption that ``agents depend upon internal
confidence signals'' in the absence of feedback?}

In the absence of feedback, observers can only rely on internal
estimates of performance to guide updates to their model of the
reliability of their sensory apparatus (inferences about \(M\)).
Previous work (e.g.~Guggenmos et al., Elife 2106,
\url{https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13388}) has shown that confidence
signals can provide signals that drive perceptual learning in the
absence of feedback. This has motivated our model simulation on the
adaptive benefits of bimodal inference for metacognition, where the
learning signal \(\epsilon_M\) (i.e., the difference between the choice
and its probability) drives inferences about \(M\). Please note that we
have removed this section following Comment 9 of Reviewer 1.

\hypertarget{comment-6}{%
\subsubsection{Comment 6}\label{comment-6}}

\textbf{And what licences the assumption that internal confidence
feedback corresponds to ``the absolute of the posterior log ratio'' (did
you mean the log of the posterior ratio)?}

We mean the absolute of the log of the posterior ratio. Following first
order models (see e.g., Fleming \& Daw, Self-evaluation of
decision-making: A general Bayesian framework for metacognitive
computation, Psychol. Rev.~2017,
\url{https://doi.org/10.1037/rev0000045}), the perceptual decision and
the confidence report rely on the posterior. The distance of the log of
the posterior ratio \(L_t\) from zero becomes a measure of
decision-certainty or confidence.

\textbf{I got a bit lost here when you say that ``the precision of
sensory coding M a function of u\_t. This is largely because I couldn't
find a definition of u\_t.}

We apologize for this lack of clarity. In the model simulations on the
adaptive benefits of bimodal inference, we generated stimuli \(s_t\)
from a Bernoulli-distribution with p = q = 0.5. The value of \(u_t\) was
then defined via equation (13), following our modeling of the human
data. Please note that we have removed this section following Comment 9
of Reviewer 1.

\subsubsection{Comment 8}\label{comment-8}}

\textbf{What licences an application of Rescorla-Wagner to learning the
parameters (as in Equation 11) and, learning sensory precision as
described by M\_T (Equation 13). Are you moving from a Bayesian
framework to a reinforcement learning framework?}

We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out this inconsistency.
We have chosen the Rescorla-Wagner learning rule for simplicity: In our
model, the speed of learning about \(H\) and \(M\) varied according to
the current mode of perceptual processing and a constant learning rate.
Allowing the learning rate itself to vary as a function of preceding
experiences would add an additional level of complexity that we sought
to omit in this analysis. However, we fully agree that choosing a
Bayesian framework (e.g., a three-level HGF) would indeed be more
consistent. Please note that we have removed this section following
Comment 9 of Reviewer 1.

\subsubsection{Comment 9}\label{comment-9}}

\textbf{I am sure you have answers to these questions - but with each
new question the reader is left more and more skeptical that there is a
coherent story behind your analyses. It would have been more convincing
had you just committed to a Bayesian filter and made your points using
one update scheme, under ideal Bayesian observer assumptions.}

\textbf{Unlike your piecemeal scheme, things like the hierarchical
Gaussian filter estimates the sensory and prior decisions explicitly and
these estimates underwrite posterior inference. In your scheme, the
sensory precision M appears to have no influence on perceptual inference
(which is why, presumably you call it metacognition). The problem with
this is that your motivation for systematic fluctuations in precision is
weakened. This is because improved metacognition does not improve
perception --- it only improves the perception of perception.}

\textbf{In light of the above, can I suggest that you remove Section 5.8
and use your model in the preceding section to endorse your hypothesis
along the following lines:}

\textbf{``In summary, we hypothesized that subjects have certain
hyperpriors that are apt for accommodating fluctuations in the
predictability of their environment; i.e., people believe that their
world is inherently volatile. This means that to be Bayes optimal it is
necessary to periodically re-evaluate posterior beliefs about model
parameters. One way to do this is to periodically suspend the precision
of prior beliefs and increase the precision afforded to sensory evidence
that updates (Bayesian) beliefs about model parameters. The empirical
evidence above suggests that the timescale of this periodic scheduling
of evidence accumulation may be scale-invariant. This means that there
may exist a timescale of periodic fluctuations in precision over every
window or length of perceptual decision-making. In what follows, we
model perceptual decisions under a generative model (based upon a hazard
function to model historical or serial dependencies) with, a periodic
fluctuation in the precision of sensory evidence relative to prior
beliefs at a particular timescale. Remarkably---using Bayesian model
comparison---we find that a model with fluctuating precisions has much
greater evidence, relative to a model in the absence of fluctuating
precisions. Furthermore, we were able to quantify the dominant timescale
of periodic fluctuations; appropriate for these kinds of paradigm.''}

\textbf{Note, again, I am reading your omega\_LLR and omega\_psi as
precisions and that the periodic modulation is the hyperprior that you
are characterizing---and have discovered.}

We would like to thank Prof.~Friston for these very helpful and precise
suggestions. In brief, we now provide a quantitative assessment of model
space based on AIC (i) and have followed the suggestion of omitting
section 5.8 (ii).

In addition to the qualitative assessment of our models in the initial
version of our manuscript, we have conducted a formal model comparison
(i). Following the model comparisons in other sections of the
manuscript, we based the model comparison on AIC. We furthermore show
that the winning \emph{bimodal inference model} predicts out-of-training
variables (RT and confidence) and use simulations from posterior model
parameters to show that, in contrast to reduced models, the bimodal
inference model neither over- nor underfits the empirical data. We have
added a description of our model comparison to the Method section:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We validated the bimodal inference model in three steps: a formal
  model comparison to reduced models based on AIC (Figure 1F-G;
  Supplemental Figure S9), the prediction of within-training (stimulus-
  and history-congruence) as well as out-of-training variables (RT and
  confidence), and a qualitative reproduction of the empirical data from
  model simulations based on estimated parameters (Figure 4).
\item
  \textbf{Model comparison}. We assessed the following model space based
  on AIC:
\item
  The full \emph{bimodal inference model} (M1; Figure 1F) incorporates
  the influence of sensory information according to the parameter
  \(\alpha\) (likelihood); the integration of evidence across trials
  according to the parameter \(H\) (prior); anti-phase oscillations in
  between likelihood and prior precision according to \(\omega_{LLR}\)
  and \(\omega_{\psi}\) with parameters \(a_{LLR}\) (amplitude
  likelihood fluctuation), \(a_{\psi}\) (amplitude prior fluctuation),
  \(f\) (frequency) and \(p\) (phase).
\item
  The \emph{likelihood-oscillation-only model} (M2; Figure 1G)
  incorporates the influence of sensory information according to
  parameter \(\alpha\) (likelihood); the integration of evidence across
  trials according to parameter \(H\) (prior); oscillations in
  likelihood precision according to \(\omega_{LLR}\) with parameters
  \(a_{LLR}\) (amplitude likelihood fluctuation), \(f\) (frequency) and
  \(p\) (phase).
\item
  The \emph{prior-oscillation-only model} (M3; Figure 1G) incorporates
  the influence of sensory information according to parameter \(\alpha\)
  (likelihood); the integration of evidence across trials according to
  parameter \(H\) (prior); oscillations in the prior precision according
  to \(\omega_{\psi}\) with parameters \(a_{\psi}\) (amplitude prior
  fluctuation), \(f\) (frequency) and \(p\) (phase). Please note that
  all models M1-3 lead to shifts in the relative precision of likelihood
  and prior.
\item
  The \emph{normative-evidence-accumulation} (M4; Figure 1G)
  incorporates the influence of sensory information according to
  parameter \(\alpha\) (likelihood); the integration of evidence across
  trials according to parameter \(H\) (prior), There are no additional
  oscillations. Model M4 thus corresponds to the model proposed by Glaze
  et al.~and captures normative evidence accumulation in unpredictable
  environments using a Bayesian update scheme\textsuperscript{51}. The
  comparison against M4 tests the null hypothesis that fluctuations in
  mode emerge from a normative Bayesian model without the ad-hoc
  addition of oscillations as in models M1-3.
\item
  The \emph{no-evidence-accumulation} (M5; Figure 1G) incorporates the
  influence of sensory information according to parameter \(\alpha\)
  (likelihood). The model lacks integration of evidence across trials
  (flat prior) and oscillations. The comparison against M5 tests the
  null hypothesis that observers do not use prior information derived
  from serial dependency in perception.
\item
  \textbf{Prediction of within-training and out-of-training variables}.
  To validate our model, we correlated individual posterior parameter
  estimates with the respective conventional variables. As a sanity
  check, we tested (i), whether the estimated hazard rate \(H\)
  correlated negatively with the frequency of history-congruent choices
  and, (ii), whether the estimated sensitivity to sensory information
  \(\alpha\) correlated positively with the frequency of
  stimulus-congruent choices. In addition, we tested whether the
  posterior decision certainty (i.e.. the absolute of the log posterior
  ratio) correlated negatively with RTs and positively with confidence.
  This allowed us to assess whether our model could explain aspects of
  the data it was not fitted to (i.e., RTs and confidence).
\item
  \textbf{Simulations}. Finally, we used simulations (Figure 4,
  Supplemental Figures S10-13) to show that all model components,
  including the anti-phase oscillations governed by \(a_{\psi}\),
  \(a_{LLR}\), \(f\) and \(p\), were necessary for our model to
  reproduce the characteristics of the empirical data. This enabled us
  to assess over- or under-fitting in the bimodal inference model and
  all reduced models M2-M5. We used the posterior model parameters
  observed for humans (\(H\), \(\alpha\), \(a_{\psi}\), \(a_{LLR}\),
  \(f\), \(p\) and \(\zeta\)) to define individual parameters for
  simulation in 4317 simulated participants (i.e., equivalent to the
  number of human participants). For each participant, the number of
  simulated trials was drawn at random between 300 to 700. Inputs \(s\)
  were drawn at random for each trial, such that the sequence of inputs
  to the simulation did not contain any systematic seriality. Noisy
  observations \(u\) were generated by applying the posterior parameter
  \(\alpha\) to inputs \(s\), thus generating stimulus-congruent choices
  in \(71.36\) ± \(\ensuremath{2.6\times 10^{-3}}\)\% of trials. Choices
  were simulated based on the trial-wise choice probabilities \(y_{p}\)
  obtained from our model. Simulated data were analyzed in analogy to
  the human and mouse data. As a substitute of subjective confidence, we
  computed the absolute of the trial-wise log posterior ratio \(|L|\)
  (i.e., the posterior decision certainty).
\end{itemize}

We have also added a graphical depiction of the model space to Figure 1
(subpanels F and G):

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{./Material/added_Figure_1.png}
\caption{Figure 1 F-G}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  F. The bimodal inference model (M1) explains fluctuations between
  externally- and externally-biased modes (left panel) by two
  interacting factors: a normative accumulation of evidence according to
  parameters \(H\) (middle panel), and anti-phase oscillations in the
  precision terms \(\omega_{LLR}\) and \(\omega_{\psi}\) (right panel).
\item
  G. The control models M2-M5 were constructed by successively removing
  the anti-phase oscillations and the integration of information from
  the bimodal inference model. Please note that the
  normative-evidence-accumulation-model (M4) corresponds to the model
  proposed by Glaze et al.\textsuperscript{51}. In the
  no-evidence-accumulation model (M5), perceptual decisions depend only
  on likelihood information (flat priors).
\end{itemize}

The formal model comparison yielded clear evidence for a superiority of
the bimodal inference model, in particular over the normative Bayesian
model of evidence accumulation. The model successfully predicted both
within-training variables (as a sanity-check) and out-of-training
variables. Simulations from posterior model parameters closely followed
the empirical data (Figure 4), which was not the case for reduced models
(Supplemental Figures S10-13). We summarize these findings in the
Results section and have added a Supplemental Figure S9 to show the
distribution of observer-level AIC at the session-level (see below):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We used a maximum likelihood procedure to fit the bimodal inference
  model (M1, Figure 1F) to the behavioral data from the Confidence
  database\textsuperscript{20} and the IBL database\textsuperscript{21},
  optimizing the parameters \(\alpha\), \(H\), \(amp_{LLR}\),
  \(amp_{\psi}\), \(f\), \(p\), and \(\zeta\) (see Methods for details
  and Supplemental Table T2 for a summary of the parameters of the
  bimodal inference model). We validated our model in three steps:
  First, to show that bimodal inference does not emerge spontaneously in
  normative Bayesian models of evidence accumulation, but requires the
  ad-hoc addition of anti-phase oscillations in prior and likelihood
  precision, we compared the bimodal inference model to four control
  models (M2-5, Figure 1G). In these models, we successively removed the
  anti-phase oscillations (M2-M4) and the integration of information
  across trials (M5) from the bimodal inference model and performed a
  model comparison based on AIC.
\item
  Model M2 (\(AIC_2\) = \(\ensuremath{9.76\times 10^{4}}\) in humans and
  \(\ensuremath{4.91\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) and Model M3 (\(AIC_3\) =
  \(\ensuremath{1.19\times 10^{5}}\) in humans and
  \(\ensuremath{5.95\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) incorporated only
  oscillations of either likelihood or prior precision. Model M4
  (\(AIC_4\) = \(\ensuremath{1.69\times 10^{5}}\) in humans and
  \(\ensuremath{9.12\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) lacked any oscillations of
  likelihood and prior precision and corresponded to the normative model
  proposed by Glaze et al.\textsuperscript{51}. In model M5 (\(AIC_4\) =
  \(\ensuremath{2.01\times 10^{5}}\) in humans and
  \(\ensuremath{1.13\times 10^{5}}\) in mice), we furthermore removed
  the integration of information across trials, such that perception
  depended only in incoming sensory information (Figure 1G).
\item
  The bimodal inference model achieved the lowest AIC across the full
  model space (\(AIC_1\) = \(\ensuremath{8.16\times 10^{4}}\) in humans
  and \(\ensuremath{4.24\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) and was clearly
  superior to the normative Bayesian model of evidence accumulation
  (\(\delta_{AIC}\) = \(\ensuremath{-8.79\times 10^{4}}\) in humans and
  \(\ensuremath{-4.87\times 10^{4}}\) in mice; Supplemental Figure S9).
\item
  As a second validation of the bimodal inference model, we tested
  whether the posterior model predicted within-training and
  out-of-training variables. The bimodal inference model characterizes
  each subject by a sensitivity parameter \(\alpha\) (humans: \(\alpha\)
  = \(0.5\) ± \(\ensuremath{1.12\times 10^{-4}}\); mice: \(\alpha\) =
  \(1.06\) ± \(\ensuremath{2.88\times 10^{-3}}\)) that captures how
  strongly perception is driven by the available sensory information,
  and a hazard rate parameter \(H\) (humans: \(H\) = \(0.45\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{4.8\times 10^{-5}}\); mice: \(H\) = \(0.46\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{2.97\times 10^{-4}}\)) that controls how heavily
  perception is biased by perceptual history. The parameter \(f\)
  captures the dominant time scale at which likelihood (amplitude
  humans: \(a_{LLR}\) = \(0.5\) ± \(\ensuremath{2.02\times 10^{-4}}\);
  mice: \(a_{LLR}\) = \(0.39\) ± \(\ensuremath{1.08\times 10^{-3}}\))
  and prior precision (amplitude humans: \(a_{\psi}\) = \(1.44\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{5.27\times 10^{-4}}\); mice: \(a_{\psi}\) = \(1.71\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{7.15\times 10^{-3}}\)) fluctuated and was estimated at
  \(0.11\) ± \(\ensuremath{1.68\times 10^{-5}}\) 1/\(N_{trials}\) and
  \(0.11\) ± \(\ensuremath{1.63\times 10^{-4}}\) 1/\(N_{trials}\) in
  mice.
\item
  As a sanity check for model fit, we tested whether the frequency of
  stimulus- and history-congruent trials in the Confidence
  database\textsuperscript{20} and IBL database\textsuperscript{21}
  correlate with the estimated parameters \(\alpha\) and \(H\),
  respectively. As expected, the estimated sensitivity toward stimulus
  information \(\alpha\) was positively correlated with the frequency of
  stimulus-congruent perceptual choices (humans: \(\beta\) = \(8.4\) ±
  \(0.26\), T(\(\ensuremath{4.31\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(32.87\), p =
  \(\ensuremath{1.3\times 10^{-211}}\); mice: \(\beta\) = \(1.93\) ±
  \(0.12\), T(\(\ensuremath{2.07\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(16.21\), p =
  \(\ensuremath{9.37\times 10^{-56}}\)). Likewise, \(H\) was negatively
  correlated with the frequency of history-congruent perceptual choices
  (humans: \(\beta\) = \(-11.84\) ± \(0.5\),
  T(\(\ensuremath{4.29\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(-23.5\), p =
  \(\ensuremath{5.16\times 10^{-115}}\); mice: \(\beta\) = \(-6.18\) ±
  \(0.66\), T(\(\ensuremath{2.08\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(-9.37\), p =
  \(\ensuremath{1.85\times 10^{-20}}\)).
\item
  Our behavioral analyses reveal that humans and mice show significant
  effects of perceptual history that impaired performance in randomized
  psychophysical experiments\textsuperscript{24,28,30,31,43} (Figure 2A
  and 3A). We therefore expected that humans and mice underestimated the
  true hazard rate \(\hat{H}\) of the experimental environments
  (Confidence database\textsuperscript{20}: \(\hat{H}_{Humans}\) = 0.5 ±
  \ensuremath{1.58\times 10^{-5}}); IBL database\textsuperscript{21}:
  \(\hat{H}_{Mice}\) = 0.49 ± \ensuremath{6.47\times 10^{-5}}). Indeed,
  when fitting the bimodal inference model to the trial-wise perceptual
  choices, we found that the estimated (i.e., subjective) hazard rate
  \(H\) was lower than \(\hat{H}\) for both humans (\(\beta\) =
  \(-6.87\) ± \(0.94\), T(\(61.87\)) = \(-7.33\), p =
  \(\ensuremath{5.76\times 10^{-10}}\)) and mice (\(\beta\) = \(-2.91\)
  ± \(0.34\), T(\(112.57\)) = \(-8.51\), p =
  \(\ensuremath{8.65\times 10^{-14}}\)).
\item
  To further probe the validity of the bimodal inference model, we
  tested whether posterior model quantities could explain aspects of the
  behavioral data that the model was not fitted to. We predicted that
  the posterior decision variable \(L_t\) not only encodes perceptual
  choices (i.e., the variable used for model estimation), but should
  also predict the speed of response and subjective
  confidence\textsuperscript{30,44}. Indeed, the estimated trial-wise
  posterior decision certainty \(|L_t|\) correlated negatively with RTs
  in humans (\(\beta\) = \(\ensuremath{-4.36\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{4.64\times 10^{-4}}\),
  T(\(\ensuremath{1.98\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-9.41\), p =
  \(\ensuremath{5.19\times 10^{-21}}\)) and TDs mice (\(\beta\) =
  \(-35.45\) ± \(0.86\), T(\(\ensuremath{1.28\times 10^{6}}\)) =
  \(-41.13\), p = \(0\)). Likewise, subjective confidence reports were
  positively correlated with the estimated posterior decision certainty
  in humans (\(\beta\) = \(\ensuremath{7.63\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{8.32\times 10^{-4}}\),
  T(\(\ensuremath{2.06\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(9.18\), p =
  \(\ensuremath{4.48\times 10^{-20}}\)).
\item
  The dynamic accumulation of information inherent to our model entails
  that biases toward perceptual history are stronger when the posterior
  decision certainty at the preceding trial is
  high\textsuperscript{30,31,51}. Due to the link between posterior
  decision certainty and confidence, we reasoned that confident
  perceptual choices should be more likely to induce history-congruent
  perception at the subsequent trial\textsuperscript{30,31}. Indeed,
  logistic regression indicated that history-congruence was predicted by
  the posterior decision certainty \(|L_{t-1}|\) (humans: \(\beta\) =
  \(\ensuremath{8.22\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{1.94\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(4.25\), p =
  \(\ensuremath{2.17\times 10^{-5}}\); mice: \(\beta\) =
  \(\ensuremath{-3.72\times 10^{-3}}\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{1.83\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(-2.03\), p = \(0.04\)) and
  subjective confidence (humans: \(\beta\) = \(0.04\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{1.62\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(27.21\), p =
  \(\ensuremath{4.56\times 10^{-163}}\)) at the preceding trial.
\item
  As a third validation of the bimodal inference model, we used the
  posterior model parameters to simulate synthetic perceptual choices
  and repeated the behavioral analyses conducted for the empirical data.
  Simulations from the bimodal inference model closely replicated our
  empirical results: Simulated perceptual decisions resulted from a
  competition of perceptual history with incoming sensory signals
  (Figure 4A). Stimulus- and history-congruence were significantly
  autocorrelated (Figure 4B-C), fluctuating in anti-phase as a
  scale-invariant process with a 1/f power law (Figure 4D-F). Simulated
  posterior certainty\textsuperscript{28,30,44} (i.e., the absolute of
  the log posterior ratio \(|L_t|\)) showed a quadratic relationship to
  the mode of sensory processing (Figure 4H), mirroring the relation of
  RTs and confidence reports to external and internal biases in
  perception (Figure 2G-H and Figure 3G-H). Crucially, the overlap
  between empirical and simulated data broke down when we removed the
  anti-phase oscillations or the accumulation of evidence over time from
  the bimodal inference model (Supplemental Figure S10-13).
\item
  In sum, computational modeling suggested that between-mode
  fluctuations are best explained by two interlinked processes (Figure
  1E): (i), the dynamic accumulation of information across successive
  trials mandated by normative Bayesians model of evidence accumulation
  and, (ii), ongoing anti-phase oscillations in the impact of external
  and internal information.

  \textbf{Supplemental Figure S9}. Comparison of the bimodal inference
  model against reduced control models.
\item
  A. Group-level AIC. The bimodal inference model (M1) achieved the
  lowest AIC across the full model space (\(AIC_1\) =
  \(\ensuremath{8.16\times 10^{4}}\) in humans and
  \(\ensuremath{4.24\times 10^{4}}\) in mice). Model M2 (\(AIC_2\) =
  \(\ensuremath{9.76\times 10^{4}}\) in humans and
  \(\ensuremath{4.91\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) and Model M3 (\(AIC_3\) =
  \(\ensuremath{1.19\times 10^{5}}\) in humans and
  \(\ensuremath{5.95\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) incorporated only
  oscillations of either likelihood or prior precision. Model M4
  (\(AIC_4\) = \(\ensuremath{1.69\times 10^{5}}\) in humans and
  \(\ensuremath{9.12\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) lacked any oscillations of
  likelihood and prior precision and corresponded to the normative model
  proposed by Glaze et al.\textsuperscript{51}. In model M5 (\(AIC_4\) =
  \(\ensuremath{2.01\times 10^{5}}\) in humans and
  \(\ensuremath{1.13\times 10^{5}}\) in mice), we furthermore removed
  the integration of information across trials, such that perception
  depended only in incoming sensory information.
\item
  B. Subject-level AIC. Here, we show the distribution of AIC values at
  the subject-level. AIC for the bimodal inference model tended to be
  smaller than AIC for the comparator models (statistical comparison to
  the second-best model M2 in humans: \(\beta\) = \(-1.71\) ± \(0.19\),
  T(\(\ensuremath{8.57\times 10^{3}}\)) = \(-8.85\), p =
  \(\ensuremath{1.06\times 10^{-18}}\); mice:
  T(\ensuremath{1.57\times 10^{3}}) = -3.08, p =
  \(\ensuremath{2.12\times 10^{-3}}\)).
\end{itemize}

In light of our response to Comments 1 - 9 of Reviewer 1, we agree that
a complete and extensive investigation of the relation between bimodal
inference, learning about changes in the environment and the relation to
metacognition may be beyond the scope of the current manuscript: Both
Reviewer 1 and 3 (see below) have shared that the manuscript is too long
and should be streamlined. Yet evaluating the full model space (e.g.,
comparing update rules for inferences about \(H\) and \(M\), testing for
an influence of beliefs about \(M\) on learning about \(H\) etc.) would
make the manuscript even longer. We are therefore happy to follow
Prof.~Fristons suggestions to omit section 5.8. We have changed the
manuscript in the following ways:

When introducing \(\omega_{LLR}\), we identify it as the precision
afforded to the likelihood, referring to the Bayesian framework, and
refer to fluctuations in mode as a hyperprior.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To allow for \emph{bimodal inference}, i.e., alternating periods of
  internally- and externally-biased modes of perceptual processing that
  occur irrespective of the sequence of preceding experiences, we
  assumed that likelihood and prior vary in their influence on the
  perceptual decision according to fluctuations governed by
  \(\omega_{LLR}\) and \(\omega_{\psi}\). These anti-phase sine
  functions (defined by amplitudes \(a_{LLR/\psi}\), frequency \(f\) and
  phase \(p\)) determine the precision afforded to the likelihood and
  prior\textsuperscript{53}. The implicit anti-phase fluctuations are
  mandated by Bayes-optimal formulations in which inference depends only
  on the relative values of prior and likelihood precision (i.e., the
  Kalman gain\textsuperscript{54}). As such, \(\omega_{LLR}\) and
  \(\omega_{\psi}\) implement a hyperprior\textsuperscript{55} in which
  the likelihood and prior precisions are shifted against each other at
  a dominant timescale defined by \(f\).
\end{itemize}

We have deleted the section 5.8 and added a summary of our modeling
approach to the discussion, closely following the text recommended by
Prof.~Friston:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  (\ldots) Yet relying too strongly on serial dependencies may come at a
  cost: When accumulating over time, internal predictions may eventually
  override external information, leading to circular and false
  inferences about the state of the environment\textsuperscript{57}.
  Akin to the wake-sleep-algorithm in machine
  learning\textsuperscript{58}, bimodal inference may help to determine
  whether errors result from external input or from internally-stored
  predictions: During internal mode, sensory processing is more strongly
  constrained by predictive processes that auto-encode the agent's
  environment. Conversely, during external mode, the network is driven
  predominantly by sensory inputs\textsuperscript{18}. Between-mode
  fluctuations may thus generate an unambiguous error signal that aligns
  internal predictions with the current state of the environment in
  iterative test-update-cycles\textsuperscript{58}. On a broader scale,
  between-mode fluctuations may thus regulate the balance between
  feedforward versus feedback contributions to perception and thereby
  play a adaptive role in metacognition and reality
  monitoring\textsuperscript{59}.
\item
  We hypothesized that observers have certain hyperpriors that are apt
  for accommodating fluctuations in the predictability of their
  environment, i.e., people believe that their world is inherently
  volatile. To be Bayes optimal, it is therefore necessary to
  periodically re-evaluate posterior beliefs about the parameters that
  define an internal generative model of the external sensory
  environment. One way to do this is to periodically suspend the
  precision of prior beliefs and increase the precision afforded to
  sensory evidence, thus updating Bayesian beliefs about model
  parameters.
\item
  The empirical evidence above suggests that the timescale of this
  periodic scheduling of evidence accumulation may be scale-invariant.
  This means that there may exist a timescale of periodic fluctuations
  in precision over every window or length of perceptual
  decision-making. Bimodal inference predicts perceptual decisions under
  a generative model (based upon a hazard function to model serial
  dependencies between subsequent trials) with periodic fluctuations in
  the precision of sensory evidence relative to prior beliefs at a
  particular timescale. Remarkably, a systematic model comparison based
  on AIC indicated that a model with fluctuating precisions has much
  greater evidence, relative to a model in the absence of fluctuating
  precisions. This ad-hoc addition of oscillations to a normative
  Bayesian model of evidence accumulation\textsuperscript{51} allowed us
  to quantify the dominant timescale of periodic fluctuations mode at
  approximately 0.11 1/\(N_{trials}\) in humans and mice that is
  appropriate for these kinds of paradigms.

Following the deletion of section 5.8, we have adapted the last sentence
of the abstract and the last paragraph of the introduction:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  (\ldots) We propose that between-mode fluctuations generate
  unambiguous error signals that enable optimal inference in volatile
  environments.
\item
  When less sensitive to external stimulus information, humans and mice
  did not behave more randomly, but showed stronger serial dependencies
  in their perceptual choices\textsuperscript{22--33}. These serial
  dependencies may be understood as driven by internal predictions that
  reflect the autocorrelation of natural
  environments\textsuperscript{34} and bias perception toward preceding
  experiences\textsuperscript{30,31,35}. Computational modeling
  indicated that ongoing changes in perceptual performance may be driven
  by systematic fluctuations between externally- and internally-oriented
  modes of sensory analysis. We suggest that such \emph{bimodal
  inference} may help to build stable internal representations of the
  sensory environment despite an ongoing stream of sensory information.

\textbf{This begs the question as to whether you want to pursue the 1/f
story. You refer to this as ``noise''. However, there is no noise in
this setup. I think what you meant was that the fluctuations are scale
free, because they evinced a power law. I am sure that there are scale
free aspects of these kinds of hyperpriors; however, in the context of
your paradigm I wonder whether you should just ignore the scale free
aspect and focus on your estimated temporal scale implicit in f.~This
means you don't have to hand wave about self-organized criticality in
the discussion and focus upon your hypothesis.}

We would like to thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We agree that
the discussion of self-organized criticality is far from the data. We
have omitted this section from the discussion. With respect to \(f\), we
have adapted the manuscript to make clear that it captures the dominant
timescale of fluctuations in mode:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  (\ldots) This implements a hyperprior\textsuperscript{55} in which the
  likelihood and prior precisions are shifted against each other at a
  dominant timescale defined by \(f\): (\ldots)
\item
  (\ldots) The parameter \(f\) captured the dominant time scale at which
  likelihood and prior precision were shifted against each other and was
  estimated at 0.11 1/\(N_{trials}\) in both humans and mice.

  a model with fluctuating precisions has much greater evidence,

\subsubsection{Comment 19}\label{comment-19}}

\textbf{Line 178, when you say that the fluctuations may arise due to
``changes in level of tonic arousal or on-task attention'', I think you
need to qualify this. In predictive processing, on-task attention is
exactly the modulation of sensory precision, relative to prior precision
that you are characterizing here. Tonic arousal may be another thing may
or may not confound your current results.}

Thank you very much for pointing this out. We have adapted the
discussion to make the distinction between attention in the predictive
processing sense and the broader issue of task engagement (reflecting
fluctuations in arousal, fatigue etc.) clearer (see also our responses
above):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  As a functional explanation for bimodal inference, we propose that
  perception temporarily disengages from internal predictions to form
  stable inferences about the statistical properties of the sensory
  environment. Between-mode fluctuations may thus elude circular
  inferences that occur when both the causes and the encoding of sensory
  stimuli are volatile\textsuperscript{19,57}). By the same token, we
  suggest that fluctuations in mode occur at the level of perceptual
  processing\textsuperscript{26,30,46,47}, and are not a passive
  phenomenon that is primarily driven by factors situated up- or
  downstream of sensory analysis.
\item
  How does attention relate to between-mode fluctuations? According to
  predictive processing, attention corresponds to the precision afforded
  to the probability distributions that underlie perceptual
  inference\textsuperscript{53}. As outlined above, between-mode
  fluctuations can be understood as ongoing shifts in the precision
  afforded to likelihood (\emph{external mode}) and prior
  (\emph{internal mode}), respectively. When the precision afforded to
  prior or likelihood increases, posterior precision increases, which
  leads to faster RTs and higher confidence. When defined from the
  perspective of predictive processing as the precision afforded to
  likelihood and prior\textsuperscript{53}, fluctuations in attention
  may thus provide a plausible explanation for the quadratic
  relationship between mode and RTs and confidence (Figure 2H and J;
  Figure 3I; Figure 3I).
\item
  Outside of the predictive processing field, attention is often
  understood in the context of task engagement\textsuperscript{63},
  which varies according to the availability of cognitive resources that
  are modulated by factors such as tonic arousal, familiarity with the
  task, or fatigue\textsuperscript{63}. Our results suggest that
  internal mode processing cannot be completely reduced to intervals of
  low task engagement: In addition to shorter RTs and elevated
  confidence, choices during internal mode were not random or globally
  biased, but driven by perceptual history (Supplemental Figures S6-7).
  Moreover, our computational model identified the dominant timescale of
  between-mode fluctuations at 0.11 1/\(N_{trials}\), which may be
  compatible with fluctuations in arousal\textsuperscript{64}, but is
  faster than to be expected for the development of task familiarity or
  fatigue.
\item
  However, in interpreting the impact of between-mode fluctuations on
  perceptual accuracy, speed of response and confidence, it is important
  to consider that global modulators such as tonic arousal are known to
  have non-linear effects on task performance\textsuperscript{65}: In
  perceptual tasks, performance seems so be highest during mid-level
  arousal, whereas low- and high-level arousal lead to reduced accuracy
  and slower responses\textsuperscript{65}. This contrasts with the
  effects of bimodal inference, where accuracy increases linearly as one
  moves from internal to external mode, and responses become faster at
  both ends of the mode spectrum.
\item
  Of note, high phasic arousal has been shown to suppress multi-domain
  biases in decision-making in humans and mice\textsuperscript{66--68},
  including the biases toward perceptual history\textsuperscript{28}
  that we implicate in internal mode processing. The increase in
  response speed and history congruence over time (Supplemental Section
  9.4) may argue against insufficient training as an alternative
  explanation for internal mode processing, but may also taken as a sign
  of waning arousal. The multiple mechanistic mappings to RTs and
  confidence therefore warrant more direct measures of arousal (such as
  pupil size\textsuperscript{28,65,66,68--70}, motor
  behavior\textsuperscript{69,70}, or neural data\textsuperscript{71})
  to better delineate bimodal inference from fluctuations in global
  modulators of task performance.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Comment 20}\label{comment-20}}

\textbf{When introducing Equation 2, please make it clear that the omega
terms stand in for the precisions afforded to the likelihood
(omega\_LLR) and prior (omega\_psi) that constitute the log posterior.}

We have modified the introduction of equation 2 as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Following Bayes' theorem, we reasoned that binary perceptual decisions
  depend on the log posterior ratio \(L\) of the two alternative states
  of the environment that participants learn about via noisy sensory
  information\textsuperscript{51}. We computed the posterior by
  combining the sensory evidence available at time-point \(t\) (i.e.,
  the log likelihood ratio \(LLR\)) with the prior probability \(\psi\),
  weighted by the respective precision terms \(\omega_{LLR}\) and
  \(\omega_{\psi}\):
\end{itemize}

\textbf{You can then motivate Equation 6 and 7 as implementing the
hyperprior in which the sensory and prior precisions fluctuate at a
particular time scale}.

We would like to thank the reviewer for this suggestion, which we have
added to the introduction of equations (6) and (7):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To allow for \emph{bimodal inference}, i.e., alternating periods of
  internally- and externally-biased modes of perceptual processing that
  occur irrespective of the sequence of preceding experiences, we
  assumed that likelihood and prior vary in their influence on the
  perceptual decision according to fluctuations governed by
  \(\omega_{LLR}\) and \(\omega_{\psi}\). These anti-phase sine
  functions (defined by amplitudes \(a_{LLR/\psi}\), frequency \(f\) and
  phase \(p\)) determine the precision afforded to the likelihood and
  prior\textsuperscript{53}. The implicit anti-phase fluctuations are
  mandated by Bayes-optimal formulations in which inference depends only
  on the relative values of prior and likelihood precision (i.e., the
  Kalman gain\textsuperscript{54}). As such, \(\omega_{LLR}\) and
  \(\omega_{\psi}\) implement a hyperprior\textsuperscript{55} in which
  the likelihood and prior precisions are shifted against each other at
  a dominant timescale defined by \(f\): (\ldots)
\end{itemize}

We now identify the optimized parameters at the outset of the modeling

\textbf{The authors elucidate whether periodicities in the sensitivity
to external information represent an epiphenomenon of limited processing
capacity or, alternatively, result from a structured and adaptive
mechanism of perceptual inference. Analyzing large datasets of
perceptual decision-making in humans and mice, they investigated whether
the accuracy of visual perception is constant over time or whether it
fluctuates. The authors found significant autocorrelations on the group
level and on the level of individual participants, indicating that a
stimulus-congruent response in a given trial increased the probability
of stimulus-congruent responses in the future. Furthermore, the authors
addressed whether observers cycle through periods of enhanced and
reduced sensitivity to external information or whether observers rely on
internal information in certain phases. This was quantified by whether a
response at a given trial was correlated with responses in previous
trials. The authors used computational modeling to infer the origin of
the different modes (internal vs.~external).}

\textbf{This is a very interesting and well-written manuscript, dealing

like the authors to answer or clarify.}

We would like to thank the reviewer for the evaluation of our

motor-level to our discussion.

\textbf{Minor questions}

\hypertarget{comment-1-1}{%
\subsubsection{Comment 1}\label{comment-1-1}}

\textbf{History congruent perception was defined on the basis of
response repetitions. Are we really sure that responses are repeated due
to some variant of a perceptual decision process (internal or external)
or may arise on the motor-level - independent of a perceptual source?
For instance, a response primed by residual activation in the motor
system may represent a local effect independent from a general response
bias. If indeed, a response repetition is initiated by whatever reasons
(non-perceptual), wouldn't this imply that the repeated response is per
se more related to previous than to current visual information and would
hence signal a reduced sensitivity to current external information? The
authors are discussing the option of stereotypically repeated responses
in the context of alertness. However, a tendency to repeat responses may
arise due to other reasons. For instance, may the motor priming effects
mentioned possibly explain faster RTs along with a stronger bias when in
internal-mode.}

Thanks a lot for pointing this out. In this manuscript, we attempt to
characterize the phenomenon of bimodal inference at the level of
behavior: The Confidence database consists only of behavioral data. At
the time of publishing this paper as a preprint, the IBL database had
also released only behavioral data.

We realize that it is very difficult to preclude all influences from
effects that occur at the level of behavior. Not all studies in the
confidence database have used a counter-balanced mapping between the
perceptual decision and the associated motor-response. In the IBL data,
the mapping between the perceptual decision and the associated
motor-response is fixed (turning a response wheel left or right
depending on the perceived location of a grating). Confidence reports
also provide only indirect information on motor- vs.~perceptual effects.
One may speculate that, if a response was driven by residual activity in
the motor system, it may be more likely to be a lapse and be accompanied
by reduced confidence. By contrast, we found that confidence was, on
average, elevated for history-congruent choices.

That being said, behavioral analyses alone are insufficient to rule out
the contribution of motor-related effects to seriality in choices. This
would require analyses of additional types of data, such as video
tracking of the motor response or even neural data collected in brain
areas directly related to motor behavior. While this analysis is beyond
the scope of the present manuscript, we plan to carry out these analyses
using the recent data publication of the IBL, that contains, among
others, video tracking of the motor response (turning of the response
wheel) and neuropixel recording across the whole brain, including
premotor and motor cortex\textsuperscript{71}.

We have added these considerations to the discussion of potential
confounds:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Residual activation of the motor system may provide another
  contribution to serial biases in perceptual
  choices\textsuperscript{72}. Such motor-driven priming may lead to
  errors in randomized psychophysical designs, resembling the phenomenon
  that we identify as internally-biased processing\textsuperscript{73}.
  Moreover, residual activation of the motor system may lead to faster
  responses, and thus constitutes an alternative explanation for the
  quadratic relationship of mode with RTs\textsuperscript{72}. The
  observation of elevated confidence for stronger biases toward internal
  mode speaks against the proposition that residual activation of the
  motor system is the primary driver of serial choice biases, since
  strong motor-driven priming should lead to frequent lapses that are
  typically associated reduced confidence\textsuperscript{74}. Likewise,
  perceptual history effects have repeatedly been replicated in
  experiments with counter-balanced stimulus-response
  mappings\textsuperscript{82}.
\item
  \textbf{No-response paradigms, in which perceptual decision are
  inferred from eye-movements alone, could help to better differentiate
  perceptual from motor-related effects. Likewise, video-tracking of
  response behavior and neural recording from motor- and premotor, which
  has recently been released for the IBL database\textsuperscript{71},
  may provide further insight into the relation of motor behavior to the
  perceptual phenomenon of between-mode fluctuations.}

\hypertarget{reviewer-3}{%
\subsection{Reviewer 3}\label{reviewer-3}}

\textbf{In this paper the authors propose that during perceptual
decisions, humans and mice exhibit regular oscillatory fluctuations
between an ``external'' (that places more weight on the perceptual
evidence) and an ``internal'' (that places more weight on historical
experiences) mode. In particular, the authors propose a computational
scheme in which the influences of history and current stimulus on choice
oscillate in anti phase, effectively implementing ``bimodal inference''.
The computational advantages of these scheme as well as its relation to
the underlying neurophysiology are discussed.}

\textbf{Overall, the authors make a very interesting proposal about what
drives slow fluctuations in perceptual performance during randomized
two-alternative choice tasks. This proposal relates changes in accuracy
with changes in serial choice biases, which is a timely and synthesizing
contribution. Furthermore, this proposal is backed by analyses over
several human datasets and a large dataset in mice.}

\textbf{Despite its strong empirical contribution, the paper seems
limited by the fact that alternative computational hypotheses are not
adequately considered (or at least considered in a systematic way). At
the same time, and although the paper is well written, some parts are
overly technical.}

We would like to thank the Reviewer for the very helpful comments on our
manuscript. We fully agree that the previous version of our manuscript
did not consider alternative computational hypotheses in a systematic
and adequate way. As we outline in more detail in our
point-by-point-responses below, we have addressed this issue by adding a
formal model comparison of the bimodal inference model to reduced
models, including a normative models of Bayesian evidence accumulation.
We have added null-hypothesis-testing for enhanced history-congruence
during internal mode. We have also moved a number of defensive analyses
to the Supplement.

\textbf{Major comments:}

\hypertarget{comment-1-2}{%
\subsubsection{Comment 1}\label{comment-1-2}}

\textbf{The authors collapse across various datasets in which different
tasks were employed. However, some details on the nature of these
different tasks and a discussion on the rationale of collapsing
behavioral metrics across them is missing. The authors mention that all
tasks involved binary perceptual decisions. In some parts of the
manuscript the term ``false alarms'' is mentioned, indicating a
detection protocol. Other terms in the methods section (e.g., ``set
size'') might need further clarification. Importantly, it is not clear
how reaction times were calculated in the various tasks and whether some
experiments involved free response paradigms while others interrogation/
cued paradigms (in which case RTs can be defined as the latency between
the response cue and the response).}

We would like to thank the Reviewer for this important point. Regarding
the rationale for collapsing across the studies in the Confidence
database: Having found strong evidence of apparent between-mode
fluctuations in a study on intermittent bistable
perception\textsuperscript{19}, our goal was to test whether
between-mode fluctuations were a general phenomenon in perceptual
decision-making. We thus had a lenient threshold for including studies
from the Confidence database, i.e., all that addressed the domain of
perception in 2AFC tasks. This has the advantage of looking at
perceptual 2AFC decisions in general and indicated that history effects
and bimodal inference are present in a wide variety of tasks.

At the same time, collapsing across diverse set of experiments means
that the stimuli, the timing and the way that responses were collected
differed between them. To account for this variability, we included
individual experiments as random factors in linear mixed modeling. We
also made sure that perceptual performance is comparable across studies
(Supplemental Figure S1A-B). While our analysis of the IBL database was
mainly motivated by investigating bimodal inference across species, it
also allowed us to replicate our results in a highly standardized task
that was collected across many individual subjects\textsuperscript{21}.
We have added the rationale for collapsing across studies with its
advantages and disadvantages to the \emph{Open questions and
limitations} subsection of the discussion:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Our results suggest bimodal inference as a pervasive aspect of
  perceptual decision-making in humans and mice. However, a number of
  limitations and open questions have to be considered: First, this work
  sought to understand whether fluctuations between internal and
  external mode, which we initially observed in an experiment on
  bistable perception in humans\textsuperscript{19}, represent a general
  phenomenon that occurs across a diverse set of perceptual
  decision-making tasks. Our analysis of the Confidence
  database\textsuperscript{20} therefore collapsed across all available
  experiments on binary perceptual decision-making. Individual
  experiments differed with respect to the stimuli, the manipulation of
  difficulty, the timing of trials, and the way responses were
  collected, but were highly comparable with respect to the central
  variables of stimulus- and history-congruence (Supplemental Figure
  S1A-B).
\item
  The variability across experiments, which we considered as random
  effects in all statistical analyses, enabled us to assess whether
  bimodal inference represents a general phenomenon in perceptual
  decision-making, but limited the precision at which we were able to
  investigate the relation of mode to behavioral variables such as
  timing, task difficulty, RT or confidence. This issue is partially
  resolved by our analyses of the IBL database, which replicated our
  findings in an experiment that was highly standardized with respect to
  timing, task difficulty, and behavioral read-out\textsuperscript{21}.
  It will be an important task for future research to validate our
  results on bimodal inference in a standardized dataset of comparable
  volume in humans, which is, to our knowledge, not yet available.
\end{itemize}

We apologize for the lack of clarity regarding the way we queried the
Confidence database. To select a broad variety of experiments on 2AFC
perceptual decision-making, we queried the Confidence database for
studies from the \emph{perception} category (excluding studies from the
categories \emph{cognitive}, \emph{motor}, \emph{memory} and
\emph{mixed}) and selected studies with 2AFC responses. Our previous
version of the manuscript had mentioned the variable names given to the
difficulty variable in the individual experiments (i.e., the name of the
column in the individual \emph{.txt} files provided for every experiment
in the Confidence database). The term \emph{false alarm} turned up in
the discussion of lapses of attention and arousal, which we have
re-written in response to Comment 19 by Reviewer 1 and Comment 6 by
Reviewer 3. We now provide more information on the experiments and
variables selected in the Method section:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We downloaded the human data from the Confidence
  database\textsuperscript{20} on 10/21/2020, limiting our analyses to
  the category \emph{perception}. Within this category, we selected
  studies in which participants made binary perceptual decisions between
  two alternatives. We excluded two experiments in which the average
  perceptual accuracy fell below 50\%. After excluding these
  experiments, our sample consisted of \(21.05\) million trials obtained
  from 4317 human participants and 66 individual experiments
  (Supplemental Table 1). Out of the 66 included experiments, 62
  investigated visual, 1 auditory, 2 proprioceptive, and 1 multimodal
  perception. 59 experiments were based on discrimination and 6 on
  detection, with one investigating both.
\item
  Out of the 58 experiments that provide information on RTs, 46 cued the
  response by the onset of a response screen or an additional response
  cue, whereas 14 allowed participants to respond at any time after
  stimulus onset.
\item
  21 of the 66 included experiments used fixed difficulty levels,
  whereas 45 manipulated difficulty levels within participants.
  Difficulty was manipulated via noise masks, contrast, luminance,
  presentation time, or stimulus probability for gabors, dot coherence
  for random dot kinematograms, difference in elements and set size for
  comparisons of numerosity, difference in clicks for auditory
  discrimination, temporal distance for meta-contrast masking, and
  amount of self-motion for proprioception. We treated task difficulty
  as a missing variable for the experiments that fixed it at the
  participant-level, as this precluded the computation of
  autocorrelation curves.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{comment-2-1}{%
\subsubsection{Comment 2}\label{comment-2-1}}

\textbf{The key premise that when participants do not rely on the
external stimulus they rely more on the previous trial needs to be more
clearly (and statistically) contrasted against a null hypothesis. For
instance, an null hypothesis could be that when participants place a
lower weight on the stimulus they simply choose randomly. It is
important to specify a null hypothesis such that the key premise does
not appear self-evident or circular.}

We would like to thank the reviewer for highlighting this important
point. Following this suggestion, we have explicitly tested our main
hypothesis (\(H1\): periods of reduced stimulus-congruence are periods
of enhanced reliance on history-congruence) against the following null
hypotheses:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(H0_1\): Periods of reduced stimulus-congruence are periods of
  enhanced random choices
\item
  \(H0_2\): Periods of reduced stimulus-congruence are periods of
  enhanced general bias
\end{itemize}

We present three sets of statistical analyses to test H1 against
\(H0_{1/2}\):

First, we used logistic regression to predict individual choices. Under
H1, one would expect a significant effect of perceptual history in a
logistic regression model that predicts individual choices from the
external stimulus, perceptual history and general response bias. At the
model level, one would expect higher AIC in a model without perceptual
history as a predictor of individual choices, indicating that perceptual
history influences choices beyond noise (\(H0_1\)) and general response
bias (\(H0_2\)).

In both humans and mice, we found a significant effect of perceptual
history on choices while controlling for bias. When eliminating
perceptual history as a predictor of individual choices, we found higher
AIC (providing model-level evidence against \(H0_1\) and \(H0_2\)). We
complemented this analysis by computing AIC in individual observers
(Supplemental Figure S4), and again found higher AIC in models from
which perceptual history was eliminated. We have made the following
changes to the main manuscript:

  Subsection title: Fluctuations between internal and external mode
  cannot be reduced to general response biases or random choices
\item
  The core assumption of bimodal inference - that ongoing changes in the
  sensitivity to external information are driven by internal predictions
  induced via perceptual history - needs to be contrasted against two
  alternative hypotheses: When making errors, observers may not engage
  with the task and respond stereotypically, i.e., exhibit stronger
  general biases toward one of the two potential outcomes, or simply
  choose randomly. Logistic regression confirmed that perceptual history
  made a significant contribution to perception (\(\beta\) = \(0.11\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{5.79\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(18.53\), p =
  \(\ensuremath{1.1\times 10^{-76}}\)) over and above the ongoing stream
  of external sensory information (\(\beta\) = \(2.2\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{5.87\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(375.11\), p = \(0\)) and
  general response biases toward (\(\beta\) = \(15.19\) ± \(0.08\), z =
  \(184.98\), p = \(0\)). When eliminating perceptual history as a
  predictor of individual choices at individual trials, AIC increased by
  \(\delta_{AIC}\) = \(\ensuremath{1.64\times 10^{3}}\) (see
  Supplemental Figure S4A-B for parameter- and model-level inference at
  the level of individual observers).
\end{itemize}

Mice:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In line with humans, mice were biased toward perceptual history in
  54.03\% ± 0.17\% of trials (T(163) = -7.52, p =
  \(\ensuremath{3.44\times 10^{-12}}\); Figure 4A and Supplemental
  Figure S1D). Perceptual history effects remained significant
  (\(\beta\) = \(0.51\) ± \(\ensuremath{4.49\times 10^{-3}}\), z =
  \(112.84\), p = \(0\)) when controlling for external sensory
  information (\(\beta\) = \(2.96\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{4.58\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(646.1\), p = \(0\)) and
  general response biases toward one of the two potential outcomes
  (\(\beta\) = \(-1.78\) ± \(0.02\), z = \(-80.64\), p = \(0\)). When
  eliminating perceptual history as a predictor of individual choices,
  AIC increased by \(\delta_{AIC}\) =
  \(\ensuremath{1.48\times 10^{4}}\), arguing against the notion that
  choice randomness and general response bias are the only determinants
  of perceptual performance (see Supplemental Figure S4C-D for
  parameter- and model-level inference within individual mice).
\end{itemize}

Second, we analyzed dynamic changes in history- and stimulus-congruence
(i.e., smoothed probabilities for stimulus-congruence,
history-congruence and general response bias in sliding 10 trial
time-windows). Under H1, one would expect a significant negative
correlation between the dynamic probability of stimulus- and
history-congruence. At the model level, one would expect higher AIC in a
model without history-congruence as a predictor of stimulus-congruence,
indicating that changes in the probability of history-congruence
influence stimulus-congruence beyond noise (\(H0_1\)) and general
response bias (\(H0_2\)).

In both humans and mice, we found a significant negative correlation
between history-congruence and stimulus-congruence while controlling for
general response bias. When eliminating the dynamic probability of
history-congruence as a predictor of stimulus-congruence, we found
higher AIC (providing model-level evidence against \(H0_1\) and
\(H0_2\)). The section 5.4 or our original manuscript
(\emph{Fluctuations between internal and external mode modulate
perceptual performance beyond the effect of general response biases})
complements these control analyses and has been moved to the Supplement
to stream-line the manuscript (following the Comment 12 by Reviewer 1
and Comment 9 by Reviewer 3). We have modified the main manuscript in
the following way:

Humans:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Finally, we ensured that fluctuations in stimulus- and
  history-congruence are linked to each other, while controlling for
  fluctuations in the strength of general response biases. When
  perceptual choices were less biased toward external information,
  participants relied more strongly on internal information acquired
  from perceptual history (and vice versa, \(\beta\) = \(-0.05\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{5.63\times 10^{-4}}\),
  T(\(\ensuremath{2.1\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-84.21\), p = \(0\)),
  controlling for fluctuations in the strength of general response
  biases (\(\beta\) = \(-0.06\) ± \(\ensuremath{5.82\times 10^{-4}}\),
  T(\(\ensuremath{2.1\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-103.51\), p = \(0\)).
\item
  (\ldots) Likewise, eliminating the dynamic fluctuations in
  history-congruence as a predictor of fluctuations in
  stimulus-congruence yielded an increase in AIC by \(\delta_{AIC}\) =
  \(\ensuremath{7.06\times 10^{3}}\). These results provided model-level
  evidence against the null hypotheses that fluctuations in
  stimulus-congruence are driven exclusively by choice randomness or
  general response bias (see Supplemental Section 9.2 for an in-depth
  assessment of general response bias).
\end{itemize}

Mice:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  As in humans, fluctuations in the strength of history-congruent biases
  had a significant effect on stimulus-congruence (\(\beta_1\) =
  \(-0.12\) ± \(\ensuremath{7.17\times 10^{-4}}\),
  T(\(\ensuremath{1.34\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-168.39\), p = \(0\)) beyond
  the effect of ongoing changes in general response biases (\(\beta_2\)
  = \(-0.03\) ± \(\ensuremath{6.94\times 10^{-4}}\),
  T(\(\ensuremath{1.34\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-48.14\), p = \(0\)).
  Eliminating the dynamic fluctuations in history-congruence as a
  predictor of fluctuations in stimulus-congruence resulted in an
  increase in AIC by \(\delta_{AIC}\) =
  \(\ensuremath{2.8\times 10^{4}}\). This confirmed that, in both humans
  and mice, perceptual performance is modulated by systematic
  fluctuations between externally- and internally-oriented modes of
  sensory processing that exist beyond general response bias (see
  Supplemental Section 9.2 for an in-depth assessment of general
  response bias).
\end{itemize}

Third, we analyzed full and history-conditioned psychometric curves in
external and internal mode as well as across modes. Under our main
hypothesis that periodic reductions in sensitivity to external
information are driven by increases in the impact of perceptual history,
one would expect (i) a history-dependent increase in biases and lapses
(effects of perceptual history), and (ii), a history-independent
increase in threshold (reduced sensitivity to external information).
Conversely, if what we identified as internal mode processing was in
fact driven by random choices, one would expect (i), a
history-independent increase in lapses (choice randomness), (ii), no
change in bias (no effect of perceptual history), and (iii), reduced
thresholds (reduced sensitivity to external information). In both humans
and mice, we observed the pattern predicted by H1. In response to the
comments by Reviewer 1 and 3, we have significantly streamlined the
manuscript and moved our assessment of psychometric functions to the
Supplement. We now provide a summary of our results in the main
manuscript to make our reasoning with respect to \(H0_1\) and \(H1\)
more explicit:

Humans:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To confirm that changes in the sensitivity to external information are
  indicative of internal mode processing, we estimated full and
  history-dependent psychometric curves during internal, external, and
  across modes. If, as we hypothesized, internal mode processing
  reflects an enhanced impact of perceptual history, one would expect a
  history-dependent increase in biases and lapses as well as a
  history-independent increase in threshold. Conversely, if internal
  mode processing were driven by random choices, one would expect a
  history-independent increase in lapses and threshold, and no change in
  bias. In line with our prediction, we found that internal mode
  processing was associated with a history-dependent increase in bias
  and lapse as well as a history-independent increase in threshold
  (Supplemental Section 9.3.1 and Supplemental Figure S6). This confirms
  that internal mode processing is indeed driven by an enhanced impact
  of perceptual history.
\end{itemize}

Mice:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When fitting full and history-conditioned psychometric curves to the
  data from the IBL database, we observed that internal mode processing
  was associated with a history-dependent increase in bias and lapse as
  well as a history-independent increase in threshold (Supplemental
  Section 9.3.2 and Supplemental Figure S7). This provided further
  evidence for the hypothesis that internal mode processing is driven by
  an enhanced impact of perceptual history, as opposed to increased
  choice randomness.

\subsubsection{Comment 3}\label{comment-3-1}}

\textbf{From a mechanistic (sequential sampling) perspective, several
previous papers have examined whether choice history biases influence
the starting point or the drift rate of the evidence accumulation
process. Under the former formulation, reliance on the evidence
vs.~reliance on the previous choice will be naturally anti-correlated
(the less weight you place on the evidence the more impactful the choice
history will be, assuming that the last choice is represented as a
starting point bias). This seems to be mapping onto the computational
model the authors describe, in which there is a weight on the prior, a
weight on the likelihood and the assumption that these weights fluctuate
in anti-phase. It is not obvious that this anti-phase relationship needs
to be imposed ad-hoc. Or whether it would emerge naturally (using a
mechanistic or Bayesian framework). More generally, the authors assert
that without an external mechanism prior biases would be impossible to
overcome, and this would misfit the data. However, it would be important
to a) actually show that the results cannot be explained by a single
mechanism in which the anti-phase relationship is emergent rather than
ad-hoc, b) relate the current framework with previous mechanistic
considerations of serial choice biases.}

We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We agree that
both normative Bayesian and mechanistic drift diffusion are bound to
lead to anti-correlated effects of sensory information and perceptual
history \emph{at the level of individual trials}. This, however, does
not necessarily entail slow fluctuations in the impact of sensory
information and perceptual history that evolve \emph{over many
consecutive trials}. We now provide a systematic model comparison and
discuss our model in relation to drift diffusion models and descriptive
models that assume slow changes in the latent parameters underlying
perceptual decision-making (such as Roy et al., Neuron 2021 or Ashwood
et al.~Nature Neuroscience et al.~2022). We also discuss the ad-hoc
nature of the bimodal inference model in the subsection
\emph{Limitations and open questions}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We used a maximum likelihood procedure to fit the bimodal inference
  model (M1, Figure 1F) to the behavioral data from the Confidence
  database\textsuperscript{20} and the IBL database\textsuperscript{21},
  optimizing the parameters \(\alpha\), \(H\), \(amp_{LLR}\),
  \(amp_{\psi}\), \(f\), \(p\), and \(\zeta\) (see Methods for details
  and Supplemental Table T2 for a summary of the parameters of the
  bimodal inference model). We validated our model in three steps:
  First, to show that bimodal inference does not emerge spontaneously in
  normative Bayesian models of evidence accumulation, but requires the
  ad-hoc addition of anti-phase oscillations in prior and likelihood
  precision, we compared the bimodal inference model to four control
  models (M2-5, Figure 1G). In these models, we successively removed the
  anti-phase oscillations (M2-M4) and the integration of information
  across trials (M5) from the bimodal inference model and performed a
  model comparison based on AIC.
\item
  Model M2 (\(AIC_2\) = \(\ensuremath{9.76\times 10^{4}}\) in humans and
  \(\ensuremath{4.91\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) and Model M3 (\(AIC_3\) =
  \(\ensuremath{1.19\times 10^{5}}\) in humans and
  \(\ensuremath{5.95\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) incorporated only
  oscillations of either likelihood or prior precision. Model M4
  (\(AIC_4\) = \(\ensuremath{1.69\times 10^{5}}\) in humans and
  \(\ensuremath{9.12\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) lacked any oscillations of
  likelihood and prior precision and corresponded to the normative model
  proposed by Glaze et al.\textsuperscript{51}. In model M5 (\(AIC_4\) =
  \(\ensuremath{2.01\times 10^{5}}\) in humans and
  \(\ensuremath{1.13\times 10^{5}}\) in mice), we furthermore removed
  the integration of information across trials, such that perception
  depended only in incoming sensory information (Figure 1G).
\item
  The bimodal inference model achieved the lowest AIC across the full
  model space (\(AIC_1\) = \(\ensuremath{8.16\times 10^{4}}\) in humans
  and \(\ensuremath{4.24\times 10^{4}}\) in mice) and was clearly
  superior to the normative Bayesian model of evidence accumulation
  (\(\delta_{AIC}\) = \(\ensuremath{-8.79\times 10^{4}}\) in humans and
  \(\ensuremath{-4.87\times 10^{4}}\) in mice; Supplemental Figure S9).
\item
  In sum, computational modeling suggested that between-mode
  fluctuations are best explained by two interlinked processes (Figure
  1E): (i), the dynamic accumulation of information across successive
  trials mandated by normative Bayesian models of evidence accumulation
  and, (ii), ongoing anti-phase oscillations in the impact of external
  and internal information.
\item
  Could bimodal inference emerge spontaneously in normative models of
  perceptual decision-making? In predictive processing, the relative
  precision of prior and likelihood determines their integration into
  the posterior that determines the content of perception. At the level
  of individual trials, the perceptual impact of internal predictions
  generated from perceptual history (prior precision) and external
  sensory information (likelihood precision) are thus necessarily
  anti-correlated. The same holds for mechanistic models of drift
  diffusion, which understand choice history biases as driven by changes
  in the starting point\textsuperscript{51} or the drift rate of
  evidence accumulation\textsuperscript{32}. Under the former
  formulation, perceptual history is bound to have a stronger influence
  on perception when less weight is given to incoming sensory evidence,
  assuming that the last choice is represented as a starting point bias.
  The effects of choice history in normative Bayesian and mechanistic
  drift diffusion models can be mapped onto one another via the Bayesian
  formulation of drift diffusion\textsuperscript{60}, where the inverse
  of likelihood precision determines the amount of noise in the
  accumulation of new evidence, and prior precision determines the
  absolute shift in its starting point\textsuperscript{60}.
\item
  While it is thus clear that the impact of perceptual history and
  sensory evidence are anti-correlated \emph{at each individual trial},
  we here introduce anti-phase oscillations as an ad-hoc modification to
  model slow fluctuations in prior and likelihood precision that evolve
  \emph{over many consecutive trials} and are not mandated by normative
  Bayesian or mechanistic drift diffusion models. The bimodal inference
  model provides a reasonable explanation of the linked autocorrelations
  in stimulus- and history-congruence, as evidenced by formal model
  comparison, successful prediction of RTs and confidence as
  out-of-training variables, and a qualitative reproduction of our
  empirical data from posterior model parameter as evidence against
  over- or under-fitting.
\item
  Of note, similar non-stationarities have been observed in descriptive
  models that assume continuous\textsuperscript{61} or
  discrete\textsuperscript{12} changes in the latent states that
  modulate perceptual decision-making at slow timescales. A recent
  computational study\textsuperscript{62} has used a Hidden Markov model
  to investigate perceptual decision-making in the IBL
  database\textsuperscript{21}. In analogy to our findings, the authors
  observed that mice switch between temporally extended
  \emph{strategies} that last for more than 100 trials: During
  \emph{engaged} states, perception was highly sensitive to external
  sensory information. During \emph{disengaged} states, in turn, choice
  behavior was prone to errors due to enhanced biases toward one of the
  two perceptual outcomes\textsuperscript{62}. Despite the conceptual
  differences to our approach (discrete states in a Hidden Markov model
  that correspond to switches between distinct decision-making
  strategies\textsuperscript{62} vs.~gradual changes in mode that emerge
  from sequential Bayesian inference and ongoing fluctuations in the
  impact of external relative to internal information), it is tempting
  to speculate that engaged/disengaged states and between-mode
  fluctuations might tap into the same underlying phenomenon.
\item
  A third open question concerns the computational underpinnings of
  bimodal inference. The addition of slow anti-phase oscillations to the
  integration of prior and likelihood represents an ad-hoc modification
  of a normative Bayesian model of evidence
  accumulation\textsuperscript{51}. While the bimodal inference model is
  supported by formal model comparison, the successful prediction of
  out-of-training variables and the qualitative reproduction of our
  empirical data in simulations from posterior model parameters, it is
  an important task for future research to test (i), whether
  between-mode fluctuations can emerge spontaneously in hierarchical
  models of Bayesian inference, (ii), whether modes are
  continuous\textsuperscript{19} or discrete\textsuperscript{62}, and
  (iii), whether bimodal inference can be causally manipulated by
  experimental variables. We speculate that between-mode fluctuations
  may separate the perceptual contribution of internal predictions and
  external sensory data in time, creating unambiguous learning signals
  that benefit inference about the precision of prior and likelihood,
  respectively. This proposition should be tested empirically by
  relating the phenomenon of bimodal inference to performance in, e.g.,
  reversal learning, probabilistic reasoning, or metacognition.

\subsubsection{Comment 4}\label{comment-4-1}}

\textbf{The authors need to unpack their definition of history biases
since in previous work biases due to the response or the identity of the
stimulus at the previous trial are treated differently. Here, the
authors focus on response biases but it is not clear whether they could
examine also stimulus-driven history biases (in paradigms where
stimulus-response is remapped on each trial).}

We would like to thank the reviewer for raising this important point. We
defined the history-biases reported in our main manuscript by comparing
the \emph{response about the perceived} stimulus category (A vs.~B) at
the current and at the preceding trial (choice history). An alternative
would have been to define history biases by comparing the choice at the
current trial to the stimulus category \emph{presented} at the preceding
trial (stimulus history). As we show below, perceptual responses tended
to be biased not only toward choice history, but also (but to a lesser
degree) to stimulus history. This is expected, as perception was
\emph{stimulus-congruent} on approximately 75\% of trials, causing the
effects of the preceding response and the preceding stimulus to be
highly correlated. We therefore compared the effects on choice history
and stimulus history induced by trials at which perception was
\emph{stimulus-incongruent}, since those trials lead to opposite
predictions regarding the perceptual choice at the subsequent trial.

As expected, perceptual choices were attracted toward perceptual choices
at preceding stimulus-incongruent trials (i.e., a positive effect of
choice history). By contrast, perceptual choices tended to be repelled
away from the stimulus presented the preceding trial. This repulsion of
choices away from stimuli presented at stimulus-incongruent trials
confirms that the choices at stimulus-incongruent trials were the
primary driver of serial effects in perception in both humans and mice.

We now refer to our analysis on stimulus history as an additional
confound, which we present in detail in the Supplement 9.1 of our
manuscript:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  (\ldots) These serial biases were effects of choice history, i.e.,
  driven by the experiences reported at the preceding trial, and could
  not be attributed to stimulus history, i.e., to effects of the stimuli
  presented at the preceding trial (Supplemental Section 9.1).
\end{itemize}

Supplement:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The main manuscript reports the effects of perceptual history, which
  we defined as the impact of the choice at the preceding trial on the
  choice at the current trial (henceforth \emph{choice history}).
  \emph{Stimulus history}, which is defined as the impact of the
  stimulus presented at the preceding trial on the choice at the present
  trial, represents an alternative approach to this. Here, we compare
  the effects of choice history to the effects of stimulus history.
\item
  We observed a significant bias toward stimulus history (humans:
  49.76\% ± 0.1\% of trials, \(\beta\) = \(1.26\) ± \(0.94\),
  T(\(373.62\)) = \(1.34\), p = \(0.18\); mice: 51.11\% ± 0.08\% of
  trials, T(164) = 13.4, p = \(\ensuremath{3.86\times 10^{-28}}\)). The
  bias toward stimulus history was smaller than the bias toward choice
  history (humans: \(\beta\) = \(-3.53\) ± \(0.5\), T(\(66.53\)) =
  \(-7.01\), p = \(\ensuremath{1.48\times 10^{-9}}\); mice: T(164) =
  -17.21, p = \(\ensuremath{1.43\times 10^{-38}}\)).
\item
  The attraction of choices toward both preceding choices and stimuli is
  expected, as perception was \emph{stimulus-congruent} on approximately
  75\% of trials, causing choices and stimuli to be highly correlated.
  We therefore compared the effects of choice history and stimulus
  history after \emph{stimulus-incongruent} (i.e., \emph{error}) trials,
  since those trials lead to opposite predictions regarding the
  perceptual choice at the subsequent trial.
\item
  As expected from the findings presented in the main manuscript,
  perceptual choices were attracted toward perceptual choices when the
  inducing trial was stimulus-incongruent (i.e., a positive effect of
  choice history; humans: \(\beta\) = \(0.19\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{1.4\times 10^{-4}}\), z =
  \(\ensuremath{1.36\times 10^{3}}\), p = \(0\): mice: \(\beta\) =
  \(0.92\) ± \(0.01\), z = \(88.82\), p = \(0\)). By contrast,
  perceptual choices tended to be repelled away from the stimulus
  presented at preceding stimulus-incongruent trial (i.e., a negative
  effect of stimulus history; humans: \(\beta\) = \(-0.19\) ± \(0.01\),
  z = \(-16.47\), p = \(\ensuremath{5.99\times 10^{-61}}\): mice:
  \(\beta\) = \(-0.92\) ± \(0.01\), z = \(-88.76\), p = \(0\)). This
  repulsion of choices away from stimuli presented at
  stimulus-incongruent trials confirmed that choices (which are
  anti-correlated to stimuli at stimulus-incongruent trials) were the
  primary driver of attracting serial effects in perception.
\item
  In sum, the above results suggest that, in both humans and mice,
  serial dependencies were better explained by the effects of choice
  history as opposed to the effects of stimulus history. This aligns
  with a result recently published for the IBL database, where mice were
  shown to follow an \emph{action-kernel} as opposed to a
  \emph{stimulus-kernel} model when integrating information across
  trials\textsuperscript{81}.

\subsubsection{Comment 5}\label{comment-5-1}}

\textbf{Previous work, which the authors acknowledges in their
Discussion (6.5), distinguishes repetitive history biases from
alternating biases. For instance, in Braun, Urai \& Donner (2018, JoN)
participants are split into repetitive or alternating. Shouldn't the
authors define the history bias in a similar fashion? The authors point
out that attracting and repelling biases operate simultaneously across
different timescales. However, this is not warranted given Braun et. al
and other similar papers. It is not clear how this more nuanced
definition of history bias would alter the conclusions.}

Our empirical results show that, on average, history biases tend to be
repetitive (Figure 2A, Figure 3A, and the biases in the psychometric
functions in the Supplemental Figure S6-7). In fact, only 2 of the 66
experiments we included from the Confidence database\textsuperscript{20}
showed significant alternating biases (Supplemental Figure S1, please
note that history-congruence was not used in the inclusion algorithm).
However, this does not rule out the possibility that there are periods
of alternating biases in the other experiments with net repeating
effects.

Importantly, our central finding of autocorrelation in
history-congruence does not distinguish between alternating and
repetitive history biases. In the plot below, we show autocorrelation
curves for fluctuations in history-congruence for both alternation
(hazard = 0.8) and repetition (hazard = 0.2). Both were simulated for 10
blocks of a random duration between 15 and 30 trials, interleaved with
10 blocks with no history biases (hazard = 0.5). This simulation
illustrates that the autocorrelation of alternating and repeating biases
is identical for symmetric pairs of hazard rates. The autocorrelation of
history-congruence and the associated internal mode processing is
therefore not tied to repeating biases, but accommodates alternating
biases as well (which seem to be, on average and in our data, less
frequent). We therefore did not separate alternating from repeating
biases in our analysis of mode.

We apologize for not having recognized this aspect in the previous
version of the discussion. We have rewritten the paragraph on
alternating and repeating biases in the discussion, referring to the
plot below, which we have added to the Supplemental Materials.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Second, our results point to an attraction of perception toward
  preceding choices. Previous work has shown that perceptual
  decision-making is concurrently affected by both attractive and
  repulsive serial biases that operate on distinct time-scales and serve
  complementary functions for sensory
  processing\textsuperscript{27,75,76}: Short-term attraction may serve
  the decoding of noisy sensory inputs and increase the stability of
  perception, whereas long-term repulsion may enable efficient encoding
  and sensitivity to change\textsuperscript{27}. In the data analyzed
  here, history biases tended to be repetitive (Figure 2A, Figure 3A,
  Supplemental Figure S6 and S7), and only 2 of the 66 experiments of
  the Confidence database\textsuperscript{20} showed significant
  alternating biases (Supplemental Figure S1). However, as we show in
  Supplemental Figure S14, fluctuations in both alternating and
  repeating history biases generate overlapping autocorrelation curves.
  Our analysis of between-mode fluctuations is therefore not tied
  exclusively to repeating biases, but accommodates alternating biases
  as well, such that both may lead to internally-biased processing and
  reduced sensitivity to external sensory information. Future work could
  apply our approach to paradigms that boost alternating as opposed to
  repeating biases, as this would help to better understand how
  repetition and alternation are linked in terms of their computational
  function and neural implementation\textsuperscript{27}.

  our analysis is able to accommodate both repeating and alternating
  biases.

\subsubsection{Comment 6}\label{comment-6-1}}

\textbf{The arousal hypothesis seems to be ruled out too easily, merely
in the presence of a non-monotonic ``state'' vs.~RT pattern. Arousal can
have an inverted U-shaped effect on behavioral performance and recent
paper has demonstrated a non-monotonic effect of tonic arousal (baseline
pupil) on RTs and accuracy
(\url{https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.28.550956.abstract}).
More generally, the RT and confidence analyses need to be complemented,
perhaps by computational modeling using sequential sampling models, as
these behavioral metrics have multiple mechanistic mappings (e.g., a
fast RT might correspond to high SNR or an impulsive decisions driven by
a starting point bias).}

We would like to thank the reviewer for this important point.
Considering this Comment and the Comment 3 by Reviewer 1, we realize
that the quadratic relationships between mode and RTs/confidence do not
represent a convincing defensive analysis against the potential
contributions of arousal to the phenomenon that we have identified as
between-mode fluctuations. Rather, we now interpret the fluctuations of
RTs/confidence with mode as indicative of a scenario in which
between-mode fluctuations modulate a decision-variable that determines
not only the perceptual choices, but also the speed and confidence at
which they are made.

Therefore, as a first response to this comment, we have re-phrased our
assessment of RT and confidence in the following way:

Humans:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The above results point to systematic fluctuations in the
  \emph{decision variable}\textsuperscript{44} that determines
  perceptual choices, causing enhanced sensitivity to external stimulus
  information during external mode and increased biases toward preceding
  choices during internal mode. As such, fluctuations in mode should
  influence downstream aspects of behavior and cognition that operate on
  the perceptual decision variable\textsuperscript{44}. To test this
  hypothesis with respect to motor behavior and metacognition, we asked
  how bimodal inference relates to response times (RTs) and confidence
  reports. (\ldots).
\item
  (\ldots) In sum, the above results indicate that reporting behavior
  and metacognition do not map linearly onto the mode of sensory
  processing. Rather, they suggest that slow fluctuations in the
  respective impact of external and internal information are most likely
  to affect perception at an early level of sensory
  analysis\textsuperscript{46,47}. Such low-level processing may thus
  integrate perceptual history with external inputs into a decision
  variable\textsuperscript{44} that influences not only perceptual
  choices, but also the speed and confidence at which they are made.
\item
  In what follows, we probe alternative explanations for between-mode
  fluctuations, test for the existence of modes in mice, and propose a
  predictive processing model that explains fluctuations in mode ongoing
  shifts in the precision afforded to external sensory information
  relative to internal predictions driven by perceptual history.
\end{itemize}

Mice:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The above results confirm that fluctuations between internally- and
  externally-biased modes generalize to perceptual decision-making in
  mice. As in humans, we hypothesized that bimodal inference modulates
  the decision variable\textsuperscript{44} that determines not only
  perceptual choices, but also downstream aspects of mouse
  behavior\textsuperscript{44}. (\ldots). When fitting full and
  history-conditioned psychometric curves to the data from the IBL
  database, we observed that internal mode processing was associated
  with a history-dependent increase in bias and lapse as well as a
  history-independent increase in threshold (Supplemental Section 9.3.2
  and Supplemental Figure S7). Over time, the frequency of
  history-congruent choices increased alongside stimulus-congruence and
  speed of response as mice were exposed to the experiment, arguing
  against the proposition that biases toward perceptual history
  reflected an unspecific response strategy in mice who were not
  sufficiently trained on the IBL task.
\end{itemize}

Second, we have re-structured the section of defensive analyses, where
we contrast the phenomenon that we identify as fluctuating modes in
perception with stereotypical or random responses as evidence of low
task engagement, and not specifically with attention or arousal, which
we discuss below. To streamline the manuscript, we report those analyses
in detail in the Supplement (see Comments 12 by Reviewer 1 and Comment 9
by Reviewer 3).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The core assumption of bimodal inference - that ongoing changes in the
  sensitivity to external information are driven by internal predictions
  induced via perceptual history - needs to be contrasted against two
  alternative hypotheses: When making errors, observers may not engage
  with the task and respond stereotypically, i.e., exhibit stronger
  general biases toward one of the two potential outcomes, or simply
  choose randomly. Logistic regression confirmed that perceptual history
  made a significant contribution to perception (\(\beta\) = \(0.11\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{5.79\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(18.53\), p =
  \(\ensuremath{1.1\times 10^{-76}}\)) over and above the ongoing stream
  of external sensory information (\(\beta\) = \(2.2\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{5.87\times 10^{-3}}\), z = \(375.11\), p = \(0\)) and
  general response biases toward (\(\beta\) = \(15.19\) ± \(0.08\), z =
  \(184.98\), p = \(0\)).
\item
  When eliminating perceptual history as a predictor of individual
  choices at individual trials, AIC increased by \(\delta_{AIC}\) =
  \(\ensuremath{1.64\times 10^{3}}\) (see Supplemental Figure S4A-B for
  parameter- and model-level inference at the level of individual
  observers). Likewise, when eliminating slow fluctuations in
  history-congruence as a predictor of slow fluctuations in
  stimulus-congruence across trials, we observed an increase in AIC by
  \(\delta_{AIC}\) = \(\ensuremath{7.06\times 10^{3}}\). These results
  provided model-level evidence against the null hypotheses that
  fluctuations in stimulus-congruence are driven exclusively by choice
  randomness or general response bias (see Supplemental Section 9.2 for
  an in-depth assessment of general response bias).
\item
  To confirm that changes in the sensitivity to external information are
  indicative of internal mode processing, we estimated full and
  history-dependent psychometric curves during internal, external, and
  across modes. If, as we hypothesized, internal mode processing
  reflects an enhanced impact of perceptual history, one would expect a
  history-dependent increase in biases and lapses as well as a
  history-independent increase in threshold. Conversely, if internal
  mode processing were driven by random choices, one would expect a
  history-independent increase in lapses and threshold, and no change in
  bias. In line with our prediction, we found that internal mode
  processing was associated with a history-dependent increase in bias
  and lapse as well as a history-independent increase in threshold
  (Supplemental Section 9.3 and Supplemental Figure S6-7). This
  confirmed that internal mode processing is indeed driven by an
  enhanced impact of perceptual history.
\item
  In line with this, the quadratic relationship between mode and
  confidence (Figure 2J) suggested that biases toward internal
  information do not reflect a post-perceptual strategy or repeating
  preceding choices when the subjective confidence in the perceptual
  decision is low. Moreover, while responses became faster with longer
  exposure to the experiments of the Confidence database, the frequency
  of history-congruent choices increased over time, speaking against the
  proposition that participants may stereotypically repeat preceding
  choices when not yet familiar with the experimental task (see
  Supplemental Section).
\item
  Taken together, our results thus argue against recurring intervals of
  low task engagement, which may be signaled by stereotypical or random
  responses, as an alternative explanation for the phenomenon that we
  identify as bimodal inference.
\end{itemize}

Third, in response the Comment 3 by Reviewer 1, we now interpret the
quadratic relationship of mode to RTs/confidence in the context of
predictive processing views on attention\textsuperscript{53}. Based on
the Bayesian formulation of drift diffusion\textsuperscript{60}, we
propose that the effects of likelihood on prior precision on the
decision variable and, consequently, on confidence and RTs can be
translated into the mechanistic framework of drift diffusion.
Specifically, Bitzer et al.~relate likelihood precision to noise in the
accumulation process, and prior precision to the amount of shift in the
starting point\textsuperscript{60}. As a third response to this comment,
we have re-written our discussion of the quadratic relationship of mode
to RTs and Confidence, focusing on predictive processing models
attention, which we relate to mechanistic drift diffusion models:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How does attention relate to between-mode fluctuations? According to
  predictive processing, attention corresponds to the precision afforded
  to the probability distributions that underlie perceptual
  inference\textsuperscript{53}. As outlined above, between-mode
  fluctuations can be understood as ongoing shifts in the precision
  afforded to likelihood (\emph{external mode}) and prior
  (\emph{internal mode}), respectively. When the precision afforded to
  prior or likelihood increases, posterior precision increases, which
  leads to faster RTs and higher confidence. When defined from the
  perspective of predictive processing as the precision afforded to
  likelihood and prior\textsuperscript{53}, fluctuations in attention
  may thus provide a plausible explanation for the quadratic
  relationship of mode to RTs and confidence (Figure 2H and J; Figure
  3I; Figure 4I). Such effects of attention in the predictive processing
  sense can be directly related to mechanistic drift diffusion
  models\textsuperscript{60}, where both larger shifts in starting point
  (related to increased prior precision in internal mode) and lower
  noise in the accumulation of evidence (related to increased likelihood
  precision in external mode) may explain faster and more confident
  responses.
\end{itemize}

Given the correspondence between normative Bayesian and mechanistic
drift diffusion models\textsuperscript{60}, we believe that we would not
gain additional insights into the role of arousal and additional
potential confounds or causes of between-mode fluctuations by fitting
drift diffusion models as an alternative class of behavioral models to
our data. To understand the relation of arousal to the bimodal
inference, we think that it is necessary to look at data beyond
behavior, such as pupillometry, video tracking of response behavior, or
neural data. While this is beyond the scope of the current manuscript,
we plan to do these analyses in a follow-up paper, using data published
by the IBL after this paper was submitted. The IBL data now contains eye
tracking, video tracking of response behavior, and neuropixel recordings
across the whole mouse brain\textsuperscript{71}. As a fourth response
to this comment, we have re-written our discussion of attention and
arousal:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Outside of the predictive processing field, attention is often
  understood in the context of task engagement\textsuperscript{63},
  which varies according to the availability of cognitive resources that
  are modulated by factors such as tonic arousal, familiarity with the
  task, or fatigue\textsuperscript{63}. Our results suggest that
  internal mode processing cannot be completely reduced to intervals of
  low task engagement: In addition to shorter RTs and elevated
  confidence, choices during internal mode were not random or globally
  biased, but driven by perceptual history (Supplemental Figures S6-7).
  Moreover, our computational model identified the dominant timescale of
  between-mode fluctuations at 0.11 1/\(N_{trials}\), which may be
  compatible with fluctuations in arousal\textsuperscript{64}, but is
  faster than to be expected for the development of task familiarity or
  fatigue.
\item
  However, in interpreting the impact of between-mode fluctuations on
  perceptual accuracy, speed of response and confidence, it is important
  to consider that global modulators such as tonic arousal are known to
  have non-linear effects on task performance\textsuperscript{65}: In
  perceptual tasks, performance seems so be highest during mid-level
  arousal, whereas low- and high-level arousal lead to reduced accuracy
  and slower responses\textsuperscript{65}. This contrasts with the
  effects of bimodal inference, where accuracy increases linearly as one
  moves from internal to external mode, and responses become faster at
  both ends of the mode spectrum.
\item
  Of note, high phasic arousal has been shown to suppress multi-domain
  biases in decision-making in humans and mice\textsuperscript{66--68},
  including the biases toward perceptual history\textsuperscript{28}
  that we implicate in internal mode processing. The increase in
  response speed and history congruence over time (Supplemental Section
  9.4) may argue against insufficient training as an alternative
  explanation for internal mode processing, but may also taken as a sign
  of waning arousal. The multiple mechanistic mappings to RTs and
  confidence therefore warrant more direct measures of arousal (such as
  pupil size\textsuperscript{28,65,66,68--70}, motor
  behavior\textsuperscript{69,70}, or neural data\textsuperscript{71})
  to better delineate bimodal inference from fluctuations in global
  modulators of task performance.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Comment 7}\label{comment-7-1}}

\textbf{In several analysis the authors present an effect and then show
that this effects persists when key variables/ design aspects are also
taken into account (see an example at around line 70). It makes more
sense to present only one single analysis in which these key variables
are controlled for. Results cannot be interpreted if they are spurious
factors driving them so it is not clear why some of the results are
presented in two versions (``uncontrolled'' and ``controlled''
analyses).}

We apologize for this. We have updated our manuscript accordingly and
have omitted, whenever possible, reports of uncontrolled analyses
(highlighted in the main text). The most significant changes are
summarized here:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Group-level autocorrelation curves in humans: In line with previous
  work\textsuperscript{8}, we found that the probability of
  stimulus-congruence was not independent across successive trials: At
  the group level, stimulus-congruent perceptual choices were
  significantly autocorrelated for up to 15 trials (Figure 2B),
  controlling for task difficulty and the sequence of presented stimuli
  (Supplemental Figure 2A-B). (\ldots) In close analogy to
  stimulus-congruence, we found history-congruence to be significantly
  autocorrelated for up to 21 trials (Figure 2B), while controlling for
  task difficulty and the sequence of presented stimuli (Supplemental
  Figure 2A-B).
\item
  Group-level autocorrelation curves in mice: At the group level, we
  found significant autocorrelations in both stimulus-congruence (42
  consecutive trials) and history-congruence (8 consecutive trials
  (Figure 3B), while controlling for the respective autocorrelation of
  task difficulty and external stimulation (Supplemental Figure 2C-D).
\item
  Correlation between stimulus- and history-congruence in humans: When
  perceptual choices were less biased toward external information,
  participants relied more strongly on internal information acquired
  from perceptual history (and vice versa, \(\beta\) = \(-0.05\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{5.63\times 10^{-4}}\),
  T(\(\ensuremath{2.1\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-84.21\), p = \(0\),
  \textbf{controlling for fluctuations in general response biases};
  Supplemental Section 9.2).
\item
  Correlation between stimulus- and history-congruence in mice:
  Fluctuations in the strength of history-congruent biases had a
  significant effect on stimulus-congruence (\(\beta_1\) = \(-0.12\) ±
  \(\ensuremath{7.17\times 10^{-4}}\),
  T(\(\ensuremath{1.34\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-168.39\), p = \(0\)) beyond
  the effect of ongoing changes in general response biases (\(\beta_2\)
  = \(-0.03\) ± \(\ensuremath{6.94\times 10^{-4}}\),
  T(\(\ensuremath{1.34\times 10^{6}}\)) = \(-48.14\), p = \(0\)).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Comment 8}\label{comment-8-1}}

\textbf{The central empirical finding is potentially important but is
currently shadowed by more speculative sections/ discussions. For
instance, the section on the adaptive merits of the computational model
is relatively weaker compared to the empirical results. In particular,
the model is simulated without feedback (whereas most experiments employ
trial by trial feedback) and does not outperform the baseline model in
accuracy but in other secondary metrics}.

We agree with the Reviewer (see also a similar suggestion by Reviewer 1
in Comment 9). We have removed the section 5.8 and the associated
subsection of the discussion from our manuscript. We will develop a
model on the potential function of between-mode fluctuations in a
separate publication.

\textbf{Minor comments:}

\hypertarget{comment-9-1}{%
\subsubsection{Comment 9}\label{comment-9-1}}

\textbf{The amount of statistical analysis and results is often
overwhelming. The authors could streamline the presentation better such
that the main result is brought to the foreground. Currently the
manuscript resembles a technical report.}

We apologize for this. From the Results, we have moved a number of
sections to the Supplemental Materials to stream-line the manuscript
(i.e., our analysis of general response biases {[}former section 5.4{]},
the analysis of psychometric functions {[}former section 5.5{]}, and the
respective paragraphs on the IBL database). From the Discussion, we have
removed the section on self-organized criticality (also following the
suggestion of Reviewer 1). We have also moved more peripheral
statistical results to the figure legends and the method section:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We have moved the statistics on exponential decay in the
  autocorrelation to the figure legends of Figure 2B and 3B.
\item
  We have shortened the description of logistic regression models that
  predict the stimulus- and history-congruence at the index trial from
  the stimulus- and history-congruence at the preceding trials.
\item
  The section on mouse behavior now matches the logic and presentation
  of results in the human section.
\end{itemize}

We hope that these changes will increase the readability of our
manuscript.
